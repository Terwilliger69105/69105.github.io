**Session Zero:**

You were arrested on Prospero's Dream for various reasons,

You were offered to either go through trial-by-combat for your freedom or take up a job helping a group stationed on asteroid mining colony *Ypsilon 14*,

You got sent off on a routine cargo re-supply ship placed in cryostasis,

You were woken up by the ship systems which detected an issue, a dead pilot and a foreign lifeform, on the ship,

You found the captain laying dead on the ground with a ripped-open chest,

You found a man dripping a yellow acid from his mouth standing in the main cargo hold,

You attempted (and failed) to hit him with a crowbar,

The man went over and used the crowbar to gut himself in sheer disappointment at your miss,

You went back to cryosleep,

You arrived at Ypsilon 14.
