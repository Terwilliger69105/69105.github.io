**We're currently on hold!**

The game will continue, as you reead your characters are heading back too *Prospero's Dream* to be released from slavery by Brunhildh for completing your job at Ypsilon 14. Once the *Teenagers from Outer Space* game is completed we will be revisitng this system and continuing your story, new characters for those who passed and the same old characters for those who survived!

Thank you for making my first *Mothership* game so much fun, I really did enjoy running it and I'm glad you enjoyed playing in it!
