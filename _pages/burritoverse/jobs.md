Looking for something to do? Molly, your neighbor and local fixer, would be glad to help! This board is posted just on the inside of her room, always unlocked for you to come check whenever you would like, and full of little side-quests to check out!

**A to B:** Someone by the alias "H41Z" is looking for anyone who can move a bit of precious cargo from Lake Park to Apartment #037 in Del Coronado Harbor. It's hidden behind an oak tree, the only hint at location being to look a big rock under the words "God Fucks Kittens" and a knot in about nine feet up the trunk. Payout is "to be determined" according to the post, apparently it can go as high as 9,500eb but as low as 200eb depending on the amount of time in transit.

**Leaky Connections:** Daniel Robinett is trying to revive his family legacy with a new Virtual Reality version of the retro classic *Adventure*. Everything was going fine until this fresh rumor hit that a disgruntled employee dropped four packages of leaked engine source around the 'net. SegAtari doesn't want to release anything with associated drama effectively now putting the game on hold. Nobody else has found the dumps so could you get them first? There's a 1,024eb reward for each part and you'll get your name or alias in the credits, 2% of every game sale, and a free copy of the game when completed!

**Rip and Tear:** An ex-Solo turned Medtech Ripper, Jake Chromedaddy, is running out of supply for his ever-growing "Limbplacer" service. He doesn't have the time anymore to gather new parts, most of his days are spent grafting fresh arms and legs onto various boosters. He may not be able to go kill scum and get fresh body parts but he'd gladly pay anyone who can.

**Empty Space:** Orbital isn't the happiest company at the moment. Usually corps wouldn't stoop down to using fixers and black markets for their dirty work, after all the only people who use those resources are filthy peasants, but this time they want need the help. If you can steal some Arasaka goodies, maybe a set of K6 Armor or that newfangled prototype Photon Cannon they've been demoing, they'd gladly pay you in cash or luxury spaceplane tickets to any colony you'd want to visit.

**Hologram Heist:** An anonymous client is looking for anyone willing to retrieve a stolen piece of holo-art from their private collection. The piece, an AI-driven interactive projection of their old pet Jackal, apparently now resides within the Serengeti Gallery in West Hill. They're offering 5,000eb to whoever gets it back to them.

**Mob Ties:** Giuseppe Slick, a low-life mobster who's trying to take over the family business, needs to be taken out. He's usually hanging out on the patio of Beppo's Trattoria in Little Italy, a few of his chromed-out goons helping him to harass various women and pick fights with men who seem weak. There's 2,500eb on his head, each goon is an additional 500eb, and you can keep whatever was on them. Just make sure that the body isn't recognizable anymore.

**Carmageddon:** Buzzsaw is a simple man. Buzzsaw loves cars and Buzzsaw loves killing shit. Mixing the two is always good fun. Do you have any videos of cars killing shit for Buzzsaw? He'd love to pay. Driver PoV is greatly appreciated.

**Yakuza Troubles:** A girl living in the Nichiban Mall, Hina Minamoto, is having some issues. Apparently her father owed the Night City Yakuza a degree of cash, didn't tell anyone in his family, and was killed the other day in a traffic collision. The debt got passed down to her, his eldest child, and now they're harassing her. She can't pay in cash for helping get rid of the criminals, she already struggles to pay rent and get food for her two sisters, but she says she has some high-value techstash locations which she'd be glad to pass along.
