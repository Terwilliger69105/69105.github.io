**The Job Board**

Looking for something to do? Molly, your neighbor and local fixer, would be glad to help! This board is posted just on the inside of her room, always unlocked for you to come check whenever you would like, and full of little side-quests to check out! Most jobs are placed up by her, the DarkTermâ„¢ inside her room spitting things out from fax occasionally, but she'll gladly let anyone else put their own things up.

**Jobs open on August 13th, 2020**

**All jobs not labeled as completed from below!**

**Drug Runners:** Nomads are the ones usually contracted when it comes to moving a decent amount of supply outside the city. It's too bad damn near every family is in a wrecked state because their aces went to "fix that damn rod in Corporate Center and get some respect" which ended up resulting in their demise or just needing serious medical attention. So, would you be willing to move a crate of product for the Domers? They'll pay you half and half, goods and cash, for your services.

**Wrecking Crew:** Way back, when Coronado City was more than just slums, crime, black markets, and corporate factories, some bank made a tower in the middle of everything. They had decent intentions, spurring a "new downtown" area like Downtown Night City, but the tower was such an eyesore that nobody wanted to build near it. Fifteen years later Euclid's Demolitions, a ma-and-pop set of wreckers who now owns the land, wants to tear it down and convert it into something actually useful. Want to blow shit up? Make sure to bring a gun in case any gangers or crackheads aren't fans of your work!

**Testing the Exit:** Nimu has a little favor to ask. She thinks she has a good way to get between Chicago and Night City, there's a fresh exit on the north side of Isadore Island in C2 (Lake Park) which *should* only work with "whitelisted" people(s). Want to ride it there and back? She has 10eb and a couple of cool little metal cases for anyone who does it to pick from.

**Day Trip:** The Intercontinental Maglev, now open to Japan again after delays because Arasaka trials, is a really cool resource. Simply put you can get on at midnight, be in Japan by 6AM, screw around until Midnight, and be back in Night City by 6:30AM the next day. Juan, the owner of the Taco Hut, really likes a certain Mitsubishi toaster which can be bought in J-Town for about 1,500eb or on mainland Japan for 200eb. He'll pay for your ticket, it'll still be cheaper than buying form J-Town, so do you feel like helping him out? 

*Note: This job has to be taken when you start your mini for the 13th as you'll wake up at 10AM. You'll be departing on the Noon train which arrives in Japan at 6PM. If you want to stay in Japan longer than 6hrs, or just miss the Midnight train back, your character will automatically be placed on the 6AM train for the 14th and arrive in Night City during our next session, taking place on the 14th, at noon.*

**Booster Blitz:** One of the Boostergangs, the Slippery Bitches in A2, have a challenge for anyone willing. Simply enough come by their turf, the North entrance of the Uptown Mall once the businesses close down and Slaughterhouse goes home, and just try to beat their new 'borgs. If you can get out alive, something they're confident you won't be doing, then they'll pass you 500eb and a shiny new prototype gun that they found off some sad Arasaka fuck.

**Divine Movers:** Father Mark, one of the Church of the Holy Angels, has put a call out to any feeling helpful. The Church is trying to get a new organ console installed, their old one is beyond repair and the new cybernetic interface would make music from the pipes that much smoother, but their movers decided to bail for whatever reasons. Could you pick it up from Blue Light Special Sales at the East Marina, bring it to the Church, and help install it on the balcony?

**Pest Control:** Fax-Press needs some help. One of their editors for bestseller *SOLO OF FORTUNE* quit the other day in dramatic fashion and claims that he placed a virus or two on the mainframe. Their anti-virus is outdated and cheap, some MacEfii program dating back to 2012 or so, and they need a willing netrunner to check things out. Wanna give it a shot? There's a slick 1,500eb reward plus a free lifetime subscription to their magazines!

**Jobs open on August 11-B, 2020**

**A to B:** Someone by the alias "H41Z" is looking for anyone who can move a bit of precious cargo from Lake Park to Apartment #037 in Del Coronado Harbor. It's hidden behind an oak tree, the only hint at location being to look a big rock under the words "God Fucks Kittens" and a knot in about nine feet up the trunk. Payout is "to be determined" according to the post, apparently it can go as high as 9,500eb but as low as 200eb depending on the amount of time in transit.

**Leaky Connections:** Daniel Robinett is trying to revive his family legacy with a new Virtual Reality version of the retro classic *Adventure*. Everything was going fine until this fresh rumor hit that a disgruntled employee dropped four packages of leaked engine source around the 'net. SegAtari doesn't want to release anything with associated drama, effectively now putting the game on hold. Nobody else has found the dumps so could you get them first? There's a 1,024eb reward for each part, plus you'll get your name or alias in the credits, 2% of every game sale, and a free copy of the game when completed!

**Rip and Tear:** An ex-Solo turned Medtech Ripper, Jake Chromedaddy, is running out of supply for his ever-growing "Limbplacer" service. Sadly he doesn't have the time anymore to gather new parts as most of his days are packed busy grafting fresh arms and legs onto various boosters. Could you go kill some scum and take their limbs? Maybe cut up some bodies on the side of the road? He'd gladly pay!

**Empty Space:** Orbital isn't the happiest company at the moment. Usually corps wouldn't stoop down to using fixers and black markets for their dirty work, after all the only people who use those resources are filthy peasants, but this time they want (they really need) the help. If you can steal some Arasaka goodies, maybe a set of K6 Armor or that newfangled prototype Photon Cannon they've been demoing, they'd gladly pay you in cash or luxury spaceplane tickets to any colony you'd want to visit.

**Hologram Heist:** An anonymous client is looking for anyone willing to retrieve a stolen piece of holo-art from their private collection. The piece, an AI-driven interactive projection of their old pet Jackal, apparently now resides within the Serengeti Gallery in West Hill. They're offering 5,000eb to whoever gets it back to them.

**Carmageddon:** Buzzsaw is a simple man. Buzzsaw loves cars and Buzzsaw loves killing shit. Mixing the two is always good fun. Do you have any videos of cars killing shit for Buzzsaw? He'd love to pay. Driver PoV is greatly appreciated.

**Completed Jobs**

**Yakuza Troubles:** ~~A girl living in the Nichiban Mall, Hina Minamoto, is having some issues. Apparently her father owed the Night City Yakuza a degree of cash, didn't tell anyone in his family, and was killed the other day in a traffic collision. The debt got passed down to her, his eldest child, and now they're harassing her. She can't pay in cash for helping get rid of the criminals, she already struggles to pay rent and get food for her two sisters, but she says she has some high-value techstash locations which she'd be glad to pass along.~~ Completed by Hugo, Yury, Yvonne, and Nimu around ~1:30PM on August 12th, 2020. Debt paid off, shitty Yakuza acting as thugs instead of police removed from floor. Contacts acquired, techstashes acquired.

**Mob Ties:** ~~Giuseppe Slick, a low-life mobster who's trying to take over the family business, needs to be taken out. He's usually hanging out on the patio of Beppo's Trattoria in Little Italy, a few of his chromed-out goons helping him to harass various women and pick fights with men who seem weak. There's 2,500eb on his head, each goon is an additional 500eb, and you can keep whatever was on them. Just make sure that the body isn't recognizable anymore.~~ Completed by Yury and Alex at ~9:15PM on August 11-B, 2020. Two goons killed plus main man, filmed by bystanders (no evidence of where shots were coming from, just focusing on people dying and vomiting everywhere) for proof. Paid 3,500eb.
