### Notable NPCs

These are just the starting NPCs who the players may have knowledge of when starting the game.

*Warning: Lots of more details to come! Still needs lots of work. Last update as-of March 11th, 2021.*

**Oric:** Born in 1989 to the streets with no parents to his name, growing up through the collapse, Oric is a damn good fixer for a reason. Oric is your man if you want a good job. He may be rough on the outside, a mismatched replacement left arm due to a deal gone wrong and open cybernetics scaring most people away, but all he wants to do is see others get by as well as possible.

**Io:** A 20-something technophile from the outside, one of Oric's friends, and the girl who can fix up anything electronic or mechanical you bring her. Nobody knows exactly how she does what she does, her ability to work on everything from biomods and cybernetics to encrypted computers and military aerodynes is unlike anyone else, but everyone who knows her is glad to have her around.

**Pearlman:** A reformed convict, sentenced for a quadruple homicide when only eleven years old in 1997, Pearlman is your go-to guy for getting a safe path between outposts in Seattle. His full-time job is serving as a guide, notably only to locals or tourists who actually show true interest in the culture, but he also quite enjoys maintaining a library of pre-collapse media for anyone interested.

**Rez:** The guy you hate to see. The low-level commander for your local Raffen Shiv, a pack calling themselves *Hell's Devils*, he's been bent on doing any hyperviolent acts he can to rise up in the ranks. Don't be surprised if you see his signature red-and-gold cybernetic arms moving in the abandoned streets, some sort of large gun slung over his shoulder, trying to find any new potential victims. There is a mean 15,000eb bounty on his head if you can get him alive...

**The Redeemer:** A fanatical religious cultist running the only properly settled land in the city. Some say he has friends who live underground but nobody knows for sure. He follows a strange version of Christianity, purging "demons" and "evildoers" on what may as well be a first sight basis. Do something they consider sinful in their presence? Interact with the local fauna? Commit any act they disavow no matter how much they do it themselves? Get ready for a fight!
