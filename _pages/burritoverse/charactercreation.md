## Character Creation

Due to the premise of this game character creation will be handled slightly differently than usual.

---

### Role

As with every Burritoverse game, as will continue with every Burritoverse game, roles don't exist. Technically you could say "Occupation: Mercenary" or some other sort of similar thing, you are someone doing contract dirty work, but having a party of people labeled "Solo" is a bit boring.

You may distribute skills wherever you want.

---

### Lifepath

You may find the stock Lifepath tables in the *Cyberpunk 2020* core rulebook. Roll these and please message the GM with any conflicts which you come across. 

Rerolls are allowed but **must** be communicated.

---

### Stats


**When doing stats:** Choose one stat which you would like to be your "expert" stat. You may have up to **seven** points in this stat. All other stats may only go to **five**.

Players in *???* may start the game with **4D10+10** stat points. Please re-roll all 1s. If you have extra stat points then you may make them into "+1s" for things which, upon completing the first major adventure of the game (the underwater job) will automatically be applied to said attribute.

### Skills & Special Abilities & (Dis)Advantages

**When doing skills:** Choose one skill which you would like to be your "expert" skill. You may have up to **five** points in this skill. All other skills may only go to **three**. Additional points, say due to Advantages, will disappear into the void!

Skill points are determined by the usual Burritoverse formula, (INT+REF)*2, but then divided by two and rounded down. This is because you get a "Stock Skill Package" which guarantees that your character is fit for their job. You may place these points wherever you please.

The "Stock Skill Package" gives you:

**BODY:** +2 *Endurance* && +1 *Swimming* 

**COOL:** +1 *Resist Torture/Drugs*

**INT:** +2 *Awareness/Notice* && +2 *Education & General Knowledge* && +2 *Language (English)*

**REF:** +1 *Handgun* && +1 *Melee* && +1 *Submachinegun*

**TECH:** +1 *First Aid*

Special Abilities, the "role-restricted" skills of the game, don't exist anymore. This means that you may **not** put points into Authority, Charismatic Leadership, Combat Sense, Credibility, Family, Jury Rig, Resources, or Streetdeal. You may also **not** put points into supplement-based Special Abilities.

You may notice that Interface and Medtech aren't on the list of "nonexistent" abilities. This is because there's nothing to replace them. Interface has been made an Intelligence skill which anyone may buy into, we're saying INT because anyone can jack into the 'net with proper training. Medtech has been made a Tech skill which anyone can buy into, if you don't know why then note the word *Tech* being a part of *Medtech*.

Advantage and Disadvantage, similar to those from previous Burritoverse games, are allowed within this game. Changing things slightly, you may have **as many Advantages as you want** *but* only **up to twelve points of Disadvantage**. 

If you don't know how to take these, simply buy Advantages and Disadvantages with Skill Points during character creation. Advantages cost you Skill Points while Disadvantages give you Skill Points. So, if I want to take the advantage *Combat Sense +2* which costs *4SP* I'd simply mark it down on my character sheet and subtract 4SP from my Skill Points pool.

You may view [Advantage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j9NDFlP-G80zLZfFSTAyqi3PVoSjjliDU5BiIakjNdE/edit?usp=sharing) and [Disadvantage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1REj3BvO2hcfTUvVy2KOEKjCXQXv9n7SoyDV66lRFtRM/edit?usp=sharing) tables by visiting their respective hyperlinks. The [FE&C Chart](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c2_PGIUQ6I0EJpmVfX6JqyyWjxUtlI7r37oF9gRstRw/edit?usp=sharing) is also linked if you need it. These will eventually be smoothed out and in plain text on this site.

### Money

Presumably you've been doing jobs in the past. To determine this "starting cash" please use the formula ((INT+LUCK)/2)*1000 which you may use to buy whatever equipment you please.

---

### Equipment

Some equipment will be assigned to you. This includes:

**Tsunami Arms Shu-1:** SMG, +0 Accuracy, Poor Availability, Jacket Concealability, 20-round Magazine (10mm Caseless), 2/3/10 RoF, 2D6+3 Damage, Standard Reliability, 100m Range, 810eb Cost

**3x Magazines** *(Shu-1)*

**Combat Knife:** Melee, +1 Accuracy, Poor Availability, Jacket Concealability, 1D6+3 Damage, Very Reliable, 1m Range, 50eb Cost

**Gibson Bodywear:** Light Armor (0 EV), Soft, +8SP to L. Arm && R. Arm && L. Leg && R. Leg && Torso

**3x Military Ration** *(3 Meals/Ration)*

**Windproof Lighter**

In addition, if you would like, you may spend your own money as-determined above on whatever other equipment you may want. This can be pulled from any official sourcebooks and Datafortress. Make sure, it's preferred in general and nessecary if pulling equipment from online sources, that you communicate what you're getting with the GM!
