## Character Creation

Due to the premise of this game, the players being a group of enslaved individuals, character creation will be handled slightly differently than usual.

---

### Role

As with every Burritoverse game, as will continue with every Burritoverse game, roles don't exist. You may distribute skills wherever you want.

---

### Lifepath

**When doing lifepath:** Follow the tables as-usual, one event for every year starting at sixteen, but please make your final event *Enslaved (SovOil)* instead of rolling it out.

You may find the stock Lifepath tables in the *Cyberpunk 2020* core rulebook. Roll these and please message the GM with any conflicts which you come across. Rerolls are allowed but **must** be communicated.

---

### Stats


**When doing stats:** Choose one stat which you would like to be your "expert" stat. You may have up to **seven** points in this stat. All other stats may only go to **five**.

Players in *The Price of Freedom* may start the game with **4D10+10** stat points. Please re-roll all 1s. If you have extra stat points then you may make them into "+1s" for things which, upon completing the first major adventure of the game (Leaving Deimos for Mars (or wherever else)) will automatically be applied to said attribute.

### Skills & Special Abilities & (Dis)Advantages

**When doing skills:** Choose one skill which you would like to be your "expert" skill. You may have up to **five** points in this skill. All other skills may only go to **three**. Additional points, say due to Advantages, will disappear into the void!

Skill points are determined by the usual Burritoverse formula, (INT+REF)*2.

Special Abilities, the "role-restricted" skills of the game, don't exist anymore. This means that you may **not** put points into Authority, Charismatic Leadership, Combat Sense, Credibility, Family, Jury Rig, Resources, or Streetdeal. You may also **not** put points into supplement-based Special Abilities.

You may notice that Interface and Medtech aren't on there, why's that? Well, simply enough there's nothing to replace them.  Interface has been made an Intelligence skill which anyone may buy into, we're saying INT because anyone can jack into the 'net with proper training. Medtech has been made a Tech skill which anyone can buy into, if you don't know why then note the word *Tech* being a part of *Medtech*.

Advantage and Disadvantage, similar to those from previous Burritoverse games, are allowed within this game. Changing things slightly, you may have **as many Advantages as you want** *but* only **up to twelve points of Disadvantage**. 

If you don't know how to take these, simply buy Advantages and Disadvantages with Skill Points during character creation. Advantages cost you Skill Points while Disadvantages give you Skill Points. So, if I want to take the advantage *Combat Sense +2* which costs *4SP* I'd simply mark it down on my character sheet and subtract 4SP from my Skill Points pool.

You may view Advantage & Disadvantage tables at the bottom of this page.

### Money

You have no money on Deimos, see the word "slave" and what it brings along with it, but you may have money back home on Earth/Luna/Mars. 

Determine your money on your home planet by doing ((INT+LUCK)/2)*1000

### Equipment

Equipment will be assigned to you during the first game session. If you would like to be cybernetically modified please contact the GM and say with exactly what.
