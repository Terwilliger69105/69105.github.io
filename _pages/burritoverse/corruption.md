title: "Corruption"

Kipolans, due to their origin and design, give off what the higher-ups of the Order refer to as *emissions* into the world. These are always useful to the Order as the stray "evil energy" is a great way to pick up on the location of their targets.

Humans, as a result of these emissions, are occasionally known to change. Generally Kipolans use this for evil purposes, slowly taking over groups if not entire towns of humans who they convert into "disciples" who follow them. They won't notice at first, slowly finding that they're getting better at certain tasks with minor side effects, but they'll become servants and slaves to their new unwanted masters soon after.

Luckily for the parties within the Burritoverse world, Humans with good relationships to Kipolan exiles, there won't be any brainjacking going on here. Well, there won't be any Kipolan brainjacking. As you've formed good standings, helped out your non-Human friends, and grew together you've been slowly "corrupted" by these emissions without knowing it. It's time to start taking advantage, if you would like of course, now that they've had a presence for long enough.

**Uncontrollable Effects: Auras**

Auras are the telltale sign that you, just a Human, have been around a Kipolan for long enough. They take a few weeks to settle in, sometimes only a few days if you live close to your Kipolan friends, and give slight little effects based upon the status of the Kipolan(s) you're around.

Auras are entirely determined by the Game Master, adding up all number-based values (Stats, Skills, Demonic Level, OA, etc.) alongside all AERPS values and WITCH modifiers to determine exactly what will be happening to you. They're never too heavy, these light Auras from just being around Kipolans will only slightly modify your stats and skills, and they're not going to attract any but the absolute highest Order members to you.

Light Auras may change daily, simple effects (Ex: +1 Strength Feat because <Kipolan> is developing her body) with no side-effects worth mentioning past minor drowsiness (-1 REF for 2hrs) at the worst.

It's quite rare but heavier Auras may come into play. These still won't do too much, they can't change you physically or rewire you mentally, but the effects will be obviously noticable to you. These only occur when the going gets rough, situations of high stress or emotion causing stronger emissions, and wear off as soon as things smooth down.

**Controllable Effects: Corruption**

Corruption is what you get for specific interaction with your Kipolan(s). It's a development on the concept of Auras, targeted effects which increment in "tiers" (Z = Lowest, A = Highest) that feed on your Humanity level in exchange for increasingly greater physical and mental reconstruction in-line with the values of the specific Kipolan corrupting you.

You probably want to know the bad side first, right? Well the major drawback of Corruption is the more corrupt you are, the less Humanity you can have. Makes sense, right? After all you are turning "Kipolan" from it gathering up. For every five tiers of corruption you gain, the first tier being Tier Z, your max Humanity number is lowered by 10. This means that, even if I have EMP10 with no Cybernetics, my stock 100 Humanity would be lowered to 90 and my EMP would become 9/10 once I hit Tier V. Only your highest corruption tier among all values is counted so don't worry, having five Tier Vs means that your Humanity Cap only has a -10 modifier and not -50.

Now, onto the good side of things. Depending on who you're being "corrupted" by, as-mentioned above, you'll gain things in-line with their abilities. These "things" start quite small, the first tiers being small skill increases and minor stat boosts, but get larger over time. You'll find that you may gain the ability to speak Kipolan, are able to use natural weapon concealment for a favorite item, have a sense heightened past what's possible as a natural human, or go higher than usually possibile in a stat. Physical modification may happen too with things like scales, horns, claws, void-black features, and other various things appearing on your body.

Knowing what the tiers do, how do I gain them? Similarly to leveling a skill general role-playing game, by interacting with the source of it. Of course different interactions with Kipolans give different amounts of corruption, just hanging around with the girl(s) for the night may only be 1/16th of a tier which only actually counts between Tier Z and Tier U, while indulgent activities like joining Yvonne for feeding or helping Casey wire up new robots could give up to two whole tiers depending on where you are. 

There are some restrictions with gaining tiers. In both major parties, the Seltzer Boys and the Birds, corruption may never go higher than the "C" Tier. The Kipolans don't want you to lose your sense of self, they may not even want you to be corrupted in the first place out of love or case, so they'll quite gladly restrict their influence on your body. In addition, if two Kipolan entities who you have an associated corruption value with are in conflict then things go to a "balance" state. If you have a Tier L with Casey and a Tier Q with Rin then while Rin may go up, Q being lower than L, for each tier gained with Rin you lose a tier with Casey. This will continue until things are balanced out. If the conflict was over you, lets say the two girls being a bit immature and both wanting you, then the second you hit this balance point things would be resolved. Other conflicts may have other solutions.

Wait, what if I don't want these tiers? Well, you can shed corruption through various methods. Turning to the Order, engaging in church activities, stopping interaction with the Kipolan(s), talking with Nimu and the Eyes, doing research with Cassie, and just generally helping others and doing Empathy-related tasks are all examples of those methods. Even some activities which the Kipolans may take part in, Emily trying to bring joy through art and Nimu trying to heal others, provide no (and may lower) corruption. Similarly enough killing in the name of God, something the Order does quite often, actually brings corruption to an unknown (but quite feared) entity.

So can I see what my corruption tables would look like? Sadly, as much as I want to provide examples, we won't be providing any. Being able to see the progression ahead of time may cause players to try and "spec into" the "right" corruption values instead of natural role-play progression, something that would be quite lame to see happening.
