title: "Corruption"

Kipolans, due to their origin and design, give off what the higher-ups of the Order refer to as *emissions* into the world. These are always useful to the Order as the stray "evil energy" is a great way to pick up on the location of their targets.

Humans, as a result of these emissions, are occasionally known to change. Generally Kipolans use this for evil purposes, slowly taking over groups if not entire towns of humans who they convert into "disciples" who follow them. They won't notice at first, slowly finding that they're getting better at certain tasks with minor side effects, but they'll become servants and slaves to their new unwanted masters soon after.

Luckily for the parties within the Burritoverse world, Humans with good relationships to Kipolan exiles, there won't be any brainjacking going on here. Well, there won't be any Kipolan brainjacking. As you've formed good standings, helped out your non-Human friends, and grew together you've been slowly "corrupted" by these emissions without knowing it. It's time to start taking advantage, if you would like of course, now that they've had a presence for long enough.

**Uncontrollable Effects: Auras**

Auras are the telltale sign that you, just a Human, have been around a Kipolan for long enough. They take a few weeks to settle in, sometimes only a few days if you live close to your Kipolan friends, and give slight little effects based upon the status of the Kipolan(s) you're around.

Auras are entirely determined by the Game Master, adding up all number-based values (Stats, Skills, Demonic Level, OA, etc.) alongside all AERPS values and WITCH modifiers to determine exactly what will be happening to you. They're never too heavy, these light Auras from just being around Kipolans will only slightly modify your stats and skills, and they're not going to attract any but the absolute highest Order members to you.

Light Auras may change daily, simple effects (Ex: +1 Strength Feat because <Kipolan> is developing her body) with no side-effects worth mentioning past minor drowsiness (-1 REF for 2hrs) at the worst.

It's quite rare but heavier Auras may come into play. These still won't do too much, they can't change you physically or rewire you mentally, but the effects will be obviously noticable to you. These only occur when the going gets rough, situations of high stress or emotion causing stronger emissions, and wear off as soon as things smooth down.

**Controllable Effects: Corruption**

Corruption is what you get for specific interaction with your Kipolan(s). It's a development on the concept of Auras, targeted effects which increment in "tiers" (Z = Lowest, A = Highest) that feed on your Humanity level in exchange for increasingly greater physical and mental reconstruction in-line with the values of the specific Kipolan corrupting you.

The one major downside of corruption, and the thing that you have to keep in mind, is that it feeds off of your Humanity value in the same way as Cybernetics. The higher your tier goes, the lower cap of Humanity you're allowed. If you're ever worried, just remember that you'll be allowed 75 Humanity value until you pass Tier M (13th level) in the order when things start getting heavier.

Corruption tiers are gained, similarly to leveling a skill general role-playing game, by interacting with the source of it. Of course different interactions with Kipolans give different amounts of corruption, just hanging around with the girl(s) for the night may only be 1/16th of a tier which only actually counts between Tier Z and Tier U, while indulgent activities like joining Yvonne for feeding or helping Casey wire up new robots could give up to two whole tiers depending on where you are.

In both major parties, the Seltzer Boys and the Birds, corruption may never go higher than the "C" Tier. The Kipolans don't want you to lose your sense of self, they may not even want you to be corrupted in the first place out of love or case, so they'll quite gladly restrict their influence on your body.

....................
Following the same idea as Auras, but specific and based upon interaction, is a "Corruption Value" which players may gain. This is explained in lore through the story of the creation of Disciples, Humans corrupted to a point of physical and mental reconstruction into a figure which the Kipolan(s) around them desired.

Corruption increments in tiers, starting at Z (No corruption) and ascending to A (Fully corrupt, no humanity remaining) over time. Lower Humanity characters, be it naturally or due to Cybernetic modification, will gain these "tiers" quicker than High-Humanity characters. EMP means nothing in these cases, just the Humanity number coming from your EMP. 

In the case of the Seltzer Boys group, as the Kipolans have a love for the party, the party may go no higher than a Corruption tier of C (15 Humanity max) to keep them around. Kipolans in other situations may not feel the same way, generally they're taught to hate Humanity, but Exiles (the associated Kipolans) don't generally feel the same way.

Corruption Tiers may be gained through interaction with specific Kipolan entities. Hanging around them for the night may add a light amount, a sixteenth of a tier, but indulging in their favorite activities may add heavier amounts going as high as two tiers. Over time tier gain will slow, it'll never halt but similar to XP in a role-playing game a greater amount is required for the next tier up from wherever the player is at.

Low Corruption Tiers will provide small effects and no OA value to the players. Things like minor stat/skill increases, a +1 in Language (Kipolan), or minor physical modifications (slight hair color change, sharp fingernails, etc.) will occur. Of course these effects depend on whichever Kipolan is "corrupting" the player.

High Corruption Tiers will give major effects and up to 2% OA values per-tier to players. Major stat increases (up to a 18 in the favored stat of the Kipolan), major Skill increases (up to a 20 in favored skills of the Kipolan), major physical modifications (Horns, Wings, Tail, etc.), and extra abilities matching those of the "corruptor" will occur.

Corruption Tiers can wear off over time. Not interacting with, showing hostility towards, harming, or anything else against the "corruptor" will cause Tiers to go away. There are no withdrawl symptoms for low tiers, a minor stat decrease won't do much, but high tiers can cause amounts of mental or physical stress if the come-down isn't padded slightly.

If Kipolans are in conflict then gaining one corruption tier with Entity A will lower your tiers, if you have any, with Entity B. This will go on until the tiers are even, the highest you may be until the conflict is resolved. Conflict must, by AERPS classification, be "Notable" for this rule to take effect.

Example of Corruption Table, Simplified/33% Copy
Entity: Emi
Major Values: [redacted]
Tier Z: +1 REP (Kipolan) and +1 REP (Personal - Emi)
Tier Y  +1 to Paint or Draw
Tier X: +1 to INT
Tier W: +1 to Wardrobe & Style, Composition, Dance, Paint or Draw, Play Instrument
Tier V: +1 to Language (Kipolan)
...
Tier Q: Add WITCH_READMIND_MINOR, Add Noticeable Physical Feature

Note: This document is meant for player eyes as mentioned mechanics, notably "Auras" and "Corruption" in this document, are currently in a state of question. All GMs are in agreement that these mechanics would be of value to the game but would like player feedback if these ideas sound poor.
