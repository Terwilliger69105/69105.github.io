She's dead because of me. I failed her. I failed all of the humans. I failed at the one thing I was made to do. The Eyes tell me it's not my fault. I find it hard to believe. I knew she was going to do it. I knew they took her mind over.

The Eyes told me to watch for Yzin. There's going to be a change. It will be for the better. She'll be confident. She'll live. She'll be happier. But she won't be careful at first. That's what we saw earlier. I know it. She won't revert to seeming Human. She may stay demonic. We'll have to see more of the order. We can't let her leave. We need her. I'll do my best. I need to let the humans know. I wish I could speak with them easily.

---

**August 10th, 2020 - 02:11:52**

Yzin, Alex, and I went out again. It wasn't as easy to keep Yzin hidden. That was okay. She doesn't want to hide anymore. We played innocent and helpless. It attracted some gangers. We followed them into an alley. They put us at gunpoint. Yzin let them rape her. She sent a signal and we struck. They all lost their heads. The rapist had his eyes gouged out. Alex made us go into a rage with her sword. It felt good. We walked home. I got a taco with extra tomato. I like tomatoes.

---

**August 9th, 2020 - 21:11:03**

The humans who introduced me to tomato came by. They had more of their bread things. I like them. They're nice humans.

---

**August 9th, 2020 - 12:39:34**

One of the humans entered. The force tried to stop them. I got rid of it. I ran rooftops to the corporate towers to fight it. It said it would meet me there. I left. I ran south then dropped all power. It should think I'm hiding in Chinatown. I want it to stay there.

---

**August 9th, 2020 - 04:31:29**

A force is trying to enter the gate. It's not a good force. Yzin was smart. It's her gate. She made the entrance feel as-if it was a district over. They don't know we live here. The force isn't going to them. It's just waiting for prey. It's waiting for the humans. It knows it can try to influence them. Damn the force. Damn it to heaven. If I see any humans enter then I'll fight it myself.

---

**August 9th, 2020 - 03:11:54**

Yzin and Emi are gone. Their room is a gate. I can see them sleeping. Neither are comfortable. Something is going wrong. I need to know what. I can't let them stay this way. I can't let them get hurt. I hope no humans try to enter. They may be corrupted. I can't watch them die. I don't want to watch them die. I don't want to see anyone die. I hope they're safe. I have to tell Alex.

---

**August 8th, 2020 - 23:41:59**

I didn't realize who Emily was until today. Emily is Emi. She shares the same drawing style. She doesn't remember me though. I need to find a way to remind her. I wonder if she remembers at all. I hope she remembers. I know she remembers.

Mother told me about a girl she saved once. It was a lesson to teach me what I could do. It was one of the few times she openly showed me love. The girl was nicknamed Caramel. She had mismatched auras. They conflicted her. Her one aura was demonic. Her other was protective. When they clashed she would break down. A lover rejected her. They clashed. She killed herself. Mother revived her. She left for the Human world. We live with a girl named Caramel. She has mismatched auras. One is demonic. One is protective. They've formed a third and fourth. One is truely angelic. The other is scared. She lives with us. I hope she accepts me. I hope she remembers mother.

**August 8th, 2020 - 11:17:08**

Yzin and a human are going. They met one of the Order. Well other humans met the Order. 37 humans are dead by their hands. 37 who did nothing to harm the Order. I can't let the humans die. I won't let the humans die. One of the leaders will be present. Harry. He's weak. He'll probably let them kill him. He may use dirty tactics. They don't want me getting hurt. I don't care. I'm going to help.

---

**August 8th, 2020 - 03:51:29**

I can't sleep. Well I tried and failed to sleep. Yzin couldn't either. So we decided to go out. The streets are quiet now. That was nice. She was looking for prey. I helped her. We found a Slaughterhouse member raping some helpless prostitute. So we freed them. The ganger got gutted and decapitated. Yzin took the 200 we were paid and instantly refunded it. They did it on the corpse of the ganger. We took them back for those taco things still covered in blood. The tacos had tomato. I like tomatoes. I forgot to ask Yzin if she likes tomatoes. I hear the human I helped earlier still awake. I hope he's okay. I hope she's okay.

---

**August 8th, 2020 - 01:19:35**

One of the humans came to me with his friend, a knife through her chest looking like she was on the verge of death. He was crying, she was catatonic. Emily asked me to help her but I didn't need the prompt, I was already going to. Her pain was hard to bear. Something inside her was burning, a love for her other, but something else was eating at her from her past. A previous life? A past love who abandoned her. She felt like she had fifty years of life in twenty years of existence. When I brought her back she was crying tears of sorrow and love. I'm glad that she loves him. Maybe this was a test. Did she do this with a past lover? I hope not. I hope that she recovers well. I won't let her die out. She needs him and he needs her.

**August 7th, 2020 - 18:57:11**

The neighbor couple invited me over for a party. They were really nice. One could speak to me in Japanese. I'm glad I got to talk. They had a good conversation. I admitted that I killed Mother to stop her from being used. We talked about having children. Humans make these things called Tomatoes which taste really good. I saw humans growing plants indoors without soil in Chicago. I want to grow those tomato things in our home. The other girls wouldn't mind. Maybe they like tomatoes? I like the neighbors. The officer is nice too.

---

**August 6th-B, 2020 - 15:15:15**

I knew that tensions were high. Yzin tried to leave out of guilt and worry for the humans. I knew she would come back but I couldn't let her go. She has a love for him and he has a love for her. She was stuck in her head thinking she was a monster. I brought them to the Eyes and tried to help. They seem happy now. We went to a city full of monsters and plant-based creatures. Now we're at some sort of human gathering.

---

**August 4th, 2020 - 02:17:20**

I like being back with the Humans. They don't understand me. That's okay. They're nice. They get me food. They care about me. The other girls are nice. They include me. Emily seems familiar but I can't say why. I like this new home. I'm happy. The Order exists here, too. That's okay. I'll help the Humans get rid of them. I'll make sure none of the Humans pass away. I heard talk of going to outer space. I would love to. I wonder if they need protection up there.

---

**July 24th, 2020 - 11:32:45**

New humans live at the bar. They say they're going to help rebuild the city. Other humans asked if they were with the North. They said they aren't. I like knowing that. The Order works with the North. They try to screw up the new Humans. I hope the other Humans are okay. They went through the Exit. I wonder if I'll see them again.

---

**July 9th, 2020 - 06:27:11**

I tried to sleep. Some men tried to abduct me. They said they were going to take me to a show. Members of the Order. Fancy clothes. I killed them. All of them. They called for backup. I killed the backup. My clothes are ruined. I need new clothes. I wonder if the Humans sell clothes. There's a trading area near the gate in. I'm going to go look.

---

**July 8th, 2020 - 19:48:29**

Those humans helped me. Men tried to follow me from their place. They stopped them. I'm happy. I want to go back. I want to thank them. I just can't speak to them. I wish I could. I like them.

---

**June 15th, 2020 - 09:35:01**

Father's men are coming for me. The remainder of them. They stole my things in the night. A "meeting place" was set up to get it back. I went. I'm stupid. They tried to put me in a snare. I dodged it. A car fell down from a building. I shoved one of the men under it. He turned into a gory smoothie. The others tried to rush me. I used the severed arm of their friend as a weapon. I forgot about my sword. I need to remember my sword. It never leaves me. It would've got me out with less damage. My face is cut open. I wonder if those humans could help me. I don't have anything to pay them. I've seen them help others. I'll go rest. I want to go see them again.

---

**May 10th, 2020 - 02:19:39**

I want to go see those nice humans again. I know they won't understand me. That's okay. They'll give me food and water in a fair exchange. That's all I need. I stole lots of valuables and money. Forgive me. I'll stash the objects to be safe. Lots of Father's riches are there. I took nothing of Mother's. I pocketed the money. Hopefully the nice humans can clean off the filthy stains of Father's group and clean the money out. They deserve it. I should learn some of their language and tell them where I stashed Father's things. Maybe someday I'll be able to communicate with them. They helped me survive. I deserve to pay them back with my life. Money isn't enough. I think I finally know my purpose.

---

**May 9th, 2020 - 23:37:45**

He's dead. For good. By his own daughter's hands. By a sword his rival forged. I felt a weight lift off from me when I pierced his body. I also felt a desire to ruin him. So I did. His men got quick deaths as they don't deserve the attention. He did though. He got a slow and painful death. How men like him should die. One of his top assistants got away. He said that in ten year's time Mother will bare another child. I need to keep an eye out for him. I'm sure he'll try to rape mother. She didn't want me and she won't want the next. I'll make sure he fails. I'll chop his cock off myself. He doesn't deserve the right to have it. Then I'll make sure he suffers like Father had. For the good of everyone.I need to leave this cursed place. It's not my home anymore. 

---

**May 8th, 2020 - 13:56:11**

I managed to convince a group of humans to help me. I think it was because I helped them from other humans trying to kill them. I didn't understand a word they said. They didn't understand me either. But I showed them that I needed food. They took me to a "bar" as they called it. It had food. It was good food. It's not far from Kipola. I'll have to remember this place. They're nice humans who run it. They do lots of things. They seem to help people. They aren't combatants. I wish more humans were like these ones.

---

**May 7th, 2020 - 08:32:19**

Evil groups of humans won't stop coming after me. At first it was to figure out who I was. The dress and glow throw them off. Then it was to rape or murder me. None succeeded. They'll keep dying until they stop. They scream loud when I castrate the men. It's music to my ears. The women don't get off any easier. Hopefully they didn't plan for children.  Now they're trying to capture me. They smell like Father did. They have a watch with Father's symbol on it. They wear suits which presumably were given by Father. They must be working with him. Liar. He said he never worked with humans. I have to go back on my own and kill him. I can't be captured. He'll kill me if I am. I can't let him go on. I can't let him kill me. I can't let him use me like he used Mother.

---

**May 6th, 2020 - 07:10:59**

I did it. Finally. I was exiled. For the best. I killed three of the men Father was keeping over. I ruined their bodies. I dragged them to the law enforcement. They threw me out without asking Father. Father will be pissed. Good. I'll be back. I'm going to kill Father. He has to die. I know he'll be too angry to check Mother. I unplugged her vat. She's dead. I hear her voice when I see the eyes. She thanked me. I want to see her again. She told me to not die off. She told me to find a nice human. She told me to have a child out of love. I want to. I will. For her.

---

**January 8th, 2020 - 18:11:43**

Father almost broke. I made him mad on purpose. I smashed some of his equipment. I cut him with a knife. He pinned me to a bed. I kept swearing at him. I wanted him to know how much I hate him. He positioned himself like he positions himself over Mother. I told him to put it in. He knows that would get him exiled. He almost did. I wish he did. He pulled off of me. He said he'll wait. Bitch. I can't wait to leave. He'll never get what he wants.

---

**October 29th, 2019 - 10:49:21**

Father did it. He put Mother in a stasis vat. The kind that breeders use. He won't let me see her. He knows I'll kill her to save her. She doesn't deserve this. She may not have loved me but I can still love her. He says he's going to take her out weekly to inseminate her. He claims it'll work. I can still feel her presence. I know it won't work. I hope she's talking with the Eyes. They will make sure she doesn't become what she fears.

---

**February 21st, 2019 - 09:32:45**

I keep getting visions of a city. I don't know what they mean. I'm standing guarding a group of humans. There's a large man in a metal suit. He tries to shoot me. I decapitate him. I don't get it.

---

**December 29th, 2018 - 01:48:44**

Father got mad at me. Madder than usual. I disrupted his house guests. Other men like him talking about breeding Mother. He threatened me with a knife. I tried to make him use it on me. He didn't. He says he'll save it for my womb. Mother locked me inside my room. I'm going to miss a week of schooling. I don't care. Nobody that likes me is left there. I need to leave.

---

**June 19th, 2017 - 09:11:38**

I saw Ichas in a dream again. It was when he was training me for the first time. How he told me I was good. How he helped me. I'm glad to know his soul is at peace. The Eyes tell me that he has a new purpose. I need to practice more. For my mentor. Other girls ask me why I'm in love with him. I'm not. I just respect him madly. For everything. I still haven't found love. They make fun of me for that. They say I'm stupid for not having interacted with the males. I don't like them. They're assholes. I wouldn't dare have a child with them. 

---

**March 1st, 2017 - 00:31:15**

Father didn't lie. He won't stop. It burns. Everything burns. Mother says he makes it feel like that on purpose. The Eyes told me I'll get through it. I don't know how. I believe them though. They said it will be a few more years. Mother says that after so long it feels like nothing. She told him to do it to me in my sleep. I wake up coughing his seed. At least I don't feel the hour of torture. I can't wait for those years to be up.

---

**December 15th, 2016 - 23:17:54**

Father did it again. He forced himself into mother's womb and my throat. He said he'll do it every week until I turn sixteen and can be bred. Just like he'll do to Mother. I need to leave this home. I need to get myself exiled. For good. I need to kill at least two people. One will be him. One has to be him. He can't live on. I just need somewhere to go. The outside world looks scary.

---

**December 14th, 2016 - 01:38:22**

Mother won't stop crying. Father was yelling at her. He says she's purposefully stopping his pregnancy attempts. He grabbed me and dragged me to their room. He made me watch him breed her. He put himself in my mouth. Mother screamed out. I gagged. The taste was disgusting. He hit her. He said I have to learn for when I turn sixteen. He pulled out a gun to threaten us. She wanted him to kill us. He didn't. I wish he did. That would have got him killed. Bitch.

---

**July 15th, 2016 - 21:37:45**

Emi left Kipola today. She couldn't keep living where she was. She says men were harassing her. Something about her father dying. I wish my father would die. But not every parent is like mine. Maybe I don't understand death. She said she hopes we meet again. I hope so. Please Eyes. Guide her to safety. Guide her to a new family. Keep her safe. She's a good being. Let us meet again.

---

**June 2nd, 2015 - 07:21:45**

I found my photo book. It's in Father's room. He didn't destroy it. He did put something over it though. It's not anything he can usually do. I need to get it back. I told Mother. She said she'll try to help me.

---

**May 11th, 2015 - 16:31:00**

I can't find my photo book. I don't know where it went. I'm scared. Father said he was going to take away my things. I think he took it away. I hope he didn't destroy it. All of my memories with Emi are there.

---

**September 4th, 2014 - 11:13:45**

People keep looking at Emi and I. They make fun of us. They say that she's a predator. They say she needs to get away from little girls. Emi has never hurt me. I don't get other people. All we do is draw and talk. Damn them.

---

**January 22nd, 2014 - 06:31:28**

Father is forcing me to go to school. I couldn't breathe when I woke up. It feels like someone is sitting on my chest. He says I need to learn to deal with it. Mother wanted me to take a sick day. He hit her. I don't want to be here.

---

**January 1st, 2014 - 00:00:31**

I got to go to Emi's home for the new year. Her family is nice. Her Mother loves her. Her Father loves her. I wish my parents loved me. 

---

***July 19th, 2013 - 15:43:11**

Father didn't want Ichas to teach me about my sword. I'm glad Ichas doesn't care about Father. I wish to be more like Ichas. I love my sword. He says he'll train me three days a week. It's a program to get me away from school. I love it.

---

**July 3rd, 2013 - 00:07:10**

I had a strange dream. I was on top of a tower in some big city. I had a big sword. I just killed a man. People were applauding me. I didn't get why. It was strange. I wonder what it means. Mother wouldn't tell me. The Eyes say that it means I have a good future. I'll just have to wait.

---

**March 2nd, 2013 - 11:18:21**

I got taken to the outside world today. It was a class trip. We looked at the humans and what they do. Humans are funny. I like it though. They have interesting things. They can dress how they want. They have freedoms.

---

**December 25th, 2012 - 09:11:45**

Mother wanted to try something new. Father left town. She says it's a human holiday they call "Christmas" which relates to the God of the Order. Or so they claim. Mother says it has no real religious connection anymore. She gave me new pens inside of a colorful paper. It had a funny bow. I like these pens. Mother gave me a hug. I wonder if she's starting to love me. Maybe it's just because Father isn't home. I hope Father never comes back.

---

**November 14th, 2012 - 23:10:59**

The nice girl is named Emi. She said we can be friends. I want to be friends. Mother let me go visit her. Emi loves drawing. I want to see her more. Father wasn't happy that I made a friend. He says he'll have her killed as soon as she can. Mother won't let him. Mother told me to enjoy myself.

---

**November 13th, 2012 - 17:00:07**

A nice girl told me she liked my notebook. She enjoyed my drawings. She was happy to see someone else writing. It made me happy too. She had a sketch pad. She was older than me. I like her. I hope we can be friends.

---

**November 12th, 2012 - 16:11:51**

School still sucks. They made fun of me. Because my notebook. I don't care. I love my notebook. Father isn't home for a week. That's good. He beats me. He beats Mother too. I don't love him. He doesn't love either of us. He calls us tools. I'm glad I can talk with my notebook about it.

---

**November 11th, 2012 - 14:31:47**

Mother bought me this notebook. She says it has unlimited pages. I love it. I'll write in it every day. I can never talk with other people. They see me as strange. This notebook doesn't. I love this notebook. School sucks. The teachers pick on me. They say Father told them to. I don't like that. I wish he didn't. The students do too. I don't even do anything. It's my clothes. But I like my clothes. They're comfortable. The skirt is cute.
