**Welcome to the BurritoVerse Lore Page!**

Everything on this page, as-mentioned on the main Burritoverse page, is game-associated lore bits. You'll find things like writing from various characters, news reports on current events, statuses of places you've visited, descriptions of the areas you've lived, and other setting-related things. 

Zqixkinza-Kizinimu, a Lankipolan who views herself as bound to the party due to them being the first group of humans to show care for her, keeps a corkboard wall where she pins things which she's been writing. She can't speak English, she can't write it either, but the other girls in her room are gladly translating everything over to both Japanese and English for the party to see.

Emi, known to most as Emily, has a personal goal of writing about Kipola and its people to educate anyone interested. She, in a similar fashion to Nimu, has decided to make all of her writing public by placing it into a book which she leaves out and open on the coffee table of her room.
