*An odd book, what looks to be bound in human skin, sits on the table of the Girl's room. "Kipola as-told by Emi" is written on the face. You open it...*

*When God created the first man Adam alone, God said, “It is not good for man to be alone.” God created a woman for him, from the earth like him, and called her Lilith. They promptly began to argue with each other: She said, “I will not lie below,” and he said, “I will not lie below, but above, since you are fit for being below and I for being above.” She said to him, “The two of us are equal, since we are both from the earth.” And they would not listen to each other. Since Lilith saw, she uttered God's ineffable name and flew away into the air. Adam stood in prayer before his Maker and said, “Master of the Universe, the woman you gave me fled from me!”*

*The Holy Blessed one immediately dispatched the three angels Sanoy, Sansenoy, and Samangelof after her, to bring her back. God said, “If she wants to return, well and good. And if not, she must accept that a hundred of her children will die every day.” The angels pursued her and overtook her in the sea, in raging waters, (the same waters in which the Egyptians would one day drown), and told her God's orders. And yet she did not want to return. They told her they would drown her in the sea, and she replied. “Leave me alone! I was only created in order to sicken babies: if they are boys, from birth to day eight I will have power over them; if they are girls, from birth to day twenty.” When they heard her reply, they pleaded with her to come back. She swore to them in the name of the living God that whenever she would see them or their names or their images on an amulet, she would not overpower that baby, and she accepted that a hundred of her children would die every day. Therefore, a hundred of the demons die every day, and therefore, we write the names on amulets of young children. When Lilith sees them, she remembers her oath and the child is healed.*

That's Yvonne's mother. 

The original succubus, cast down from the likes of Man because she wanted to ride Adam cowgirl. Isn't it funny?

I won't write in this book often but I'll tell tales of our kind, our origins, the variants on our race, and everything else important. Hopefully it helps you to understand us.
