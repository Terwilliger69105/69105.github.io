Title: "Cyberpunk - Improvement Points"
---

Improvement Points are a system by which, through playing the game, players gain the ability to increase their skills. Three types exist, gIP, sIP, and cIP.

**gIP**, General Improvement Points, are what you get for just doing your thing.

**sIP,** Specific/Skill Improvement Points, are what you get for using your skills to solve a situation. These points are specific to the stats that are used to recieve them and cannot be used in other skills.

**cIP,** Character Improvement Points, are what you get for your character stats. These points are specific to the stats which were used to recieve them, are usually rewarded only after pushing yourself in the regard of the relevant stat, and cannot be used in other stats.

## How do I earn Improvement Points?

IPs are awarded by all sorts of things.

Showing up to the game           |  +1 gIP
Playing a longer (5+hr) session  |  +1 gIP
Completing a subplot             |  +1 gIP
Completing a plot                |  +1 gIP
Surviving extreme danger         |  +1 gIP
Good thinking in a situation     |  +1 gIP
Saving the party                 |  +1 gIP
Doing more than expected         |  +1 gIP
Using a skill properly           |  +* sIP
Training a stat                  |  +* cIP
Completing a job                 |  +* gIP

...and the list goes on.

## How do I use Improvement Points to level skills?

Let's say I want to increase my Seduction skill from a 7 to an 8.

The first thing to note is that at least half of my IP (rounded down) used must be drawn from the skill-associated sIP pool.

The formula to determine the amount of IP needed is **(levelIP * Multiplier) + Adder = IP required.** Let's break this down.

**levelIP** is just that, the level of the skill. *I have a Seduction of 7 so LevelIP = 7.*

**Multiplier** is also just the level of the skill. *I have a Seduction of 7 so Multiplier = 7.*

My **Adder** is determined by the level of my skill.

x0/x1  |  0
x2      |  5
x3      |  10
x4      |  15
x5      |  20
x6      |  25
x7      |  30
x8      |  35
x9      |  40
x10    |  45
x11    |  50

*Multiplier = 7 so Adder = 30*

Now, with all of those numbers, let's plug it in. (7IP * 7) + 30 = 79.

This means that I need 79IP, at least 39 being from my Seduction-related sIP pool, to bring Seduction to Level 8.

## How do I use Improvement Points to level stats?

This is similar but differet in two places.

1. You're going to use the same formula but, instead of needing half of the IP used to be from the cIP pool, you need at least three quarters of the IP used to be from your associated cIP pool.

2. You will need to perform an action which "cements" the stat increase to finalize it. You can level your COOL from a 6 to a 7 but the skill won't actually increase unltil you demonstrate that your character is better in this regard.

That's all the difference there is.

## Can Improvement Points do anything else?

IPs can be used to "buy off" disadvantages. Just trade an amount of IPs to the GM, usually three times the base cost, and you'll be able to strike the disadvantage from your sheet.
