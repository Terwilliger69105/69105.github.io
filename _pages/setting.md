**Location:** Experimental Energy Generation Wing, Derevo Station, Deimos.

The Experimental Energy Generation Wing (shothand EEGW) is considered both the best and worst part of Derevo Station. It's a 2kmÂ² dome, living quarters towards the surface with a large shaft leading down to the generator itself, and kept seprate from the rest of the station. Accomodations are industrial, thick metal pod-like living quarters with one communal ChemShower system and prison-like mess hall for all of the Slaves, but considered "better" than other parts of Derevo Station due to the lesser Military presence. Descending the shaft leads through multiple "layers" of generator support structure, massive chillers and patch bays which must be constantly maintained for the whole moon to not be destroyed, all the way down to the generator itself. Researchers live on the same floor as the generator. Nobody knows exactly what the generator is pulling energy from, it's never been told to the Slaves, but rumor has it that the source is quite hellish...

**Population:** 397 Slaves, 35 Researchers, 120 Military, 2 Executives
