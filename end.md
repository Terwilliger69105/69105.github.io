Nobody cares any more.

Nobody ever cared.

It was all a lie.

Every last bit of it.

The last years of my life.

They just acted nice to me.

They never fucking cared.

What do I have left?

Nothing.

Nobody wants to put time into me unless I pay them.

Nobody wants to be around me except to use me.

Nobody wants to talk with me.

I'm a fucking waste.

I left everything behind.

It's going to drive me insane.

I'll eventually turn back to masking it out.

Drugs.

Then those will push me further down.

At that point?

I'll end it.

Nobody wants me.

I'm worthless.

I'll stick around to see my game launch.

I hope it does well.

After that?

It'll just be a countdown.

If I decide to stick around I won't come back to school.

They don't want me there.

They hate me.

They think I'm worthless.

They just try to look nice.

"Oh look we're helping the sad person we're so good."

I wish it was fake.

I wish this was all a lie.

I really do.

But nobody wants to prove anything else.

Nobody ever will want to prove anything else.

Because I'm right.

Then what?

I won't do anything with myself?

Yeah.

I won't get the degree.

I'll waste away.

I'll be worthless to the system.

And at that point?

Well isn't it obvious?
