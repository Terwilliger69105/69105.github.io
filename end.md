Yesterday I had exactly where my head is at. Fun read, huh? I bet you got a good laugh out of it. Thanks.

Today I'll say what I'm going to try to do.

I'm going to try to run one last game. If it goes well then I guess stuff will continue on. If it fails then I'll fail with it and I hope by now you know what that means.

*"Why does something so serious hinge on your game?"*

Everything hinges on it because it's been the only stable part of my life since 2013. I fucked up with my trip overseas, I never wanted to see what I saw, and going to GenCon was pretty much the only thing to get my mind off of it. This game came out of that GenCon trip and this game has been about the only thing keeping me socially anchored in any way. The trip never left me, I've been fucked up since then, so once this game dies out it may as well be a signal that hey, time to pack it up and leave. Not even the thing which saved me from doing this earlier is left for me.

*"Haven't you said this before?"*

Yeah, I did twice. People pulled me out of it both times. Then, once people quit caring after a month of pulling me out of it, I started going downhill again. Now we're back to it. Isn't it great?

*"Well I'm going to help!"*

Then quit saying it and do something.

*"Are you going to re-join <thing>?"*
  
Probably not. Why would they want me being a sad/worthless/idiotic pile of shit? All I was doing was annoying people before. None of them wanted me around before. There's no point in going back. I'll stick to my own little space where I can't hurt them any more than I already have.
