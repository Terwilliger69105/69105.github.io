Nimu has a corkboard wall where she pins up journal entries, written in Kipolan and/or Japanese then translated into Englsih by Yvonne, which anyone may read. She knows that she's going to struggle to learn English, she's been trying and unable for four months, so she uses this as her little method of communication with the party while not in the presence of the Eyes.

Check for occasional updates!

I can't sleep. Well I tried and failed to sleep. Yzin couldn't either. So we decided to go out. The streets are quiet now. That was nice. She was looking for prey. I helped her. We found a Slaughterhouse member raping some helpless prostitute. So we freed them. The ganger got gutted and decapitated. Yzin took the 200 we were paid and instantly refunded it. They did it on the corpse of the ganger. We took them back for those taco things still covered in blood. The tacos had tomato. I like tomatoes. I forgot to ask Yzin if she likes tomatoes. I hear the human I helped earlier still awake. I hope he's okay. I hope she's okay.

One of the humans came to me with his friend, a knife through her chest looking like she was on the verge of death. He was crying, she was catatonic. Emily asked me to help her but I didn't need the prompt, I was already going to. Her pain was hard to bear. Something inside her was burning, a love for her other, but something else was eating at her from her past. A previous life? A past love who abandoned her. She felt like she had fifty years of life in twenty years of existence. When I brought her back she was crying tears of sorrow and love. I'm glad that she loves him. Maybe this was a test. Did she do this with a past lover? I hope not. I hope that she recovers well. I won't let her die out. She needs him and he needs her.

The neighbor couple invited me over for a party. They were really nice. One could speak to me in Japanese. I'm glad I got to talk. They had a good conversation. I admitted that I killed Mother to stop her from being used. We talked about having children. Humans make these things called Tomatoes which taste really good. I saw humans growing plants indoors without soil in Chicago. I want to grow those tomato things in our home. The other girls wouldn't mind. Maybe they like tomatoes? I like the neighbors. The officer is nice too.

I knew that tensions were high. Yzin tried to leave out of guilt and worry for the humans. I knew she would come back but I couldn't let her go. She has a love for him and he has a love for her. She was stuck in her head thinking she was a monster. I brought them to the Eyes and tried to help. They seem happy now. We went to a city full of monsters and plant-based creatures. Now we're at some sort of human gathering.

I want to go see those nice humans again. I know they won't understand me. That's okay. They'll give me food and water in a fair exchange. That's all I need. I stole lots of valuables and money. Forgive me. I'll stash the objects to be safe. Lots of Father's riches are there. I took nothing of Mother's. I pocketed the money. Hopefully the nice humans can clean off the filthy stains of Father's group and clean the money out. They deserve it. I should learn some of their language and tell them where I stashed Father's things. Maybe someday I'll be able to communicate with them. They helped me survive. I deserve to pay them back with my life. Money isn't enough. I think I finally know my purpose.

He's dead. For good. By his own daughter's hands. By a sword his rival forged. I felt a weight lift off from me when I pierced his body. I also felt a desire to ruin him. So I did. His men got quick deaths as they don't deserve the attention. He did though. He got a slow and painful death. How men like him should die. One of his top assistants got away. He said that in ten year's time Mother will bare another child. I need to keep an eye out for him. I'm sure he'll try to rape mother. She didn't want me and she won't want the next. I'll make sure he fails. I'll chop his cock off myself. He doesn't deserve the right to have it. Then I'll make sure he suffers like Father had. For the good of everyone.I need to leave this cursed place. It's not my home anymore.

I managed to convince a group of humans to help me. I think it was because I helped them from other humans trying to kill them. I didn't understand a word they said. They didn't understand me either. But I showed them that I needed food. They took me to a "bar" as they called it. It had food. It was good food. It's not far from Kipola. I'll have to remember this place. They're nice humans who run it. They do lots of things. They seem to help people. They aren't combatants. I wish more humans were like these ones.

Evil groups of humans won't stop coming after me. At first it was to figure out who I was. The dress and glow throw them off. Then it was to rape or murder me. None succeeded. They'll keep dying until they stop. They scream loud when I castrate the men. It's music to my ears. The women don't get off any easier. Hopefully they didn't plan for children.  Now they're trying to capture me. They smell like Father did. They have a watch with Father's symbol on it. They wear suits which presumably were given by Father. They must be working with him. Liar. He said he never worked with humans. I have to go back on my own and kill him. I can't be captured. He'll kill me if I am. I can't let him go on. I can't let him kill me. I can't let him use me like he used Mother.

Father did it. He put Mother in a stasis vat. The kind that breeders use. He won't let me see her. He knows I'll kill her to save her. She doesn't deserve this. She may not have loved me but I can still love her. He says he's going to take her out weekly to inseminate her. He claims it'll work. I can still feel her presence. I know it won't work. I hope she's talking with the Eyes. They will make sure she doesn't become what she fears.

I saw Ichas in a dream again. It was when he was training me for the first time. How he told me I was good. How he helped me. I'm glad to know his soul is at peace. The Eyes tell me that he has a new purpose. I need to practice more. For my mentor. Other girls ask me why I'm in love with him. I'm not. I just respect him madly. For everything. I still haven't found love. They make fun of me for that. They say I'm stupid for not having interacted with the males. I don't like them. They're assholes. I wouldn't dare have a child with them.

Father did it again. He forced himself into mother's womb and my throat. He said he'll do it every week until I turn sixteen and can be bred. Just like he'll do to Mother. I need to leave this home. I need to get myself exiled. For good. I need to kill at least two people. One will be him. One has to be him. He can't live on. I just need somewhere to go. The outside world looks scary.

Mother won't stop crying. Father was yelling at her. He says she's purposefully stopping his pregnancy attempts. He grabbed me and dragged me to their room. He made me watch him breed her. He put himself in my mouth. Mother screamed out. I gagged. The taste was disgusting. He hit her. He said I have to learn for when I turn sixteen. He pulled out a gun to threaten us. She wanted him to kill us. He didn't. I wish he did. That would have got him killed. Bitch.
