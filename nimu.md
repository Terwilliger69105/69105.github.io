Nimu has a corkboard wall where she pins up journal entries, written in Kipolan and/or Japanese then translated into Englsih by Yvonne, which anyone may read. She knows that she's going to struggle to learn English, she's been trying and unable for four months, so she uses this as her little method of communication with the party while not in the presence of the Eyes.

Check for occasional updates!

One of the humans came to me with his friend, a knife through her chest looking like she was on the verge of death. He was crying, she was catatonic. Emily asked me to help her but I didn't need the prompt, I was already going to. Her pain was hard to bear. Something inside her was burning, a love for her other, but something else was eating at her from her past. A previous life? A past love who abandoned her. She felt like she had fifty years of life in twenty years of existence. When I brought her back she was crying tears of sorrow and love. I'm glad that she loves him. Maybe this was a test. Did she do this with a past lover? I hope not. I hope that she recovers well. I won't let her die out. She needs him and he needs her.

I knew that tensions were high. Yzin tried to leave out of guilt and worry for the humans. I knew she would come back but I couldn't let her go. She has a love for him and he has a love for her. She was stuck in her head thinking she was a monster. I brought them to the Eyes and tried to help. They seem happy now. We went to a city full of monsters and plant-based creatures. Now we're at some sort of human gathering.
