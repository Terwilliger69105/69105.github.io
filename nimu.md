Nimu has a corkboard wall where she pins up journal entries, written in Kipolan and/or Japanese then translated into Englsih by Yvonne, which anyone may read. She knows that she's going to struggle to learn English, she's been trying and unable for four months, so she uses this as her little method of communication with the party while not in the presence of the Eyes.

Check for occasional updates!

One of the humans came to me with his friend, a knife through her chest looking like she was on the verge of death. He was crying, she was catatonic. Emily asked me to help her but I didn't need the prompt, I was already going to. Her pain was hard to bear. Something inside her was burning, a love for her other, but something else was eating at her from her past. A previous life? A past love who abandoned her. She felt like she had fifty years of life in twenty years of existence. When I brought her back she was crying tears of sorrow and love. I'm glad that she loves him. Maybe this was a test. Did she do this with a past lover? I hope not. I hope that she recovers well. I won't let her die out. She needs him and he needs her.

I knew that tensions were high. Yzin tried to leave out of guilt and worry for the humans. I knew she would come back but I couldn't let her go. She has a love for him and he has a love for her. She was stuck in her head thinking she was a monster. I brought them to the Eyes and tried to help. They seem happy now. We went to a city full of monsters and plant-based creatures. Now we're at some sort of human gathering.

I want to go see those nice humans again. I know they won't understand me. That's okay. They'll give me food and water in a fair exchange. That's all I need. I stole lots of valuables and money. Forgive me. I'll stash the objects to be safe. Lots of Father's riches are there. I took nothing of Mother's. I pocketed the money. Hopefully the nice humans can clean off the filthy stains of Father's group and clean the money out. They deserve it. I should learn some of their language and tell them where I stashed Father's things. Maybe someday I'll be able to communicate with them. They helped me survive. I deserve to pay them back with my life. Money isn't enough. I think I finally know my purpose.

He's dead. For good. By his own daughter's hands. By a sword his rival forged. I felt a weight lift off from me when I pierced his body. I also felt a desire to ruin him. So I did. His men got quick deaths as they don't deserve the attention. He did though. He got a slow and painful death. How men like him should die. One of his top assistants got away. He said that in ten year's time Mother will bare another child. I need to keep an eye out for him. I'm sure he'll try to rape mother. She didn't want me and she won't want the next. I'll make sure he fails. I'll chop his cock off myself. He doesn't deserve the right to have it. Then I'll make sure he suffers like Father had. For the good of everyone.I need to leave this cursed place. It's not my home anymore.

I managed to convince a group of humans to help me. I think it was because I helped them from other humans trying to kill them. I didn't understand a word they said. They didn't understand me either. But I showed them that I needed food. They took me to a "bar" as they called it. It had food. It was good food. It's not far from Kipola. I'll have to remember this place. They're nice humans who run it. They do lots of things. They seem to help people. They aren't combatants. I wish more humans were like these ones.

Evil groups of humans won't stop coming after me. At first it was to figure out who I was. The dress and glow throw them off. Then it was to rape or murder me. None succeeded. They'll keep dying until they stop. They scream loud when I castrate the men. It's music to my ears. The women don't get off any easier. Hopefully they didn't plan for children.  Now they're trying to capture me. They smell like Father did. They have a watch with Father's symbol on it. They wear suits which presumably were given by Father. They must be working with him. Liar. He said he never worked with humans. I have to go back on my own and kill him. I can't be captured. He'll kill me if I am. I can't let him go on. I can't let him kill me. I can't let him use me like he used Mother.
