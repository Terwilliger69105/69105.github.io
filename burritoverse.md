## Welcome to the Burritoverse!

This is the hub for the *Burritoverse* series of Cyberpunk-based tabletop role-playing games. We're coming up on the eighth year running, it's currently the eighth mainline game, and hopefully we can make it another eight!

**Update for Feb. 22nd, 2021**

Last night actually did run well. I can say with a decent amount of confidence that the mini went well, I have pretty much no regrets and actually enjoyed what I put out for once, and damn does it feel good. On that subject yes minis are still open, please poke me on Discord if you want one.

My entire plan for tonight is to just run as much of a mini as I can (if anyone wants one) and do some light writing. Nimu's Board will get a few more points, I need to add the jobs which would appear on the Job Board when the 12th hits, and MDD#8.019D needs to become 8.019DP so I can let others check it. 

I'm still not using the BurritoBeans account except for two select post-IRC communities. If things stay well then I'll probably go back to it Wednesday? I do still want to attempt to have people out on Saturday but I'm not going to post it in Discord. PM the alt and I'll try to organize something. 

Contact 69105L#9438 if you need me for anything as I will respond over there.
