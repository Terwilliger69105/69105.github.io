## Welcome to the Burritoverse!

This is the hub for content related to my long-running series of half-failed yet still quite fun Cyberpunk-system games. Everything started back in 2013 when I went to a panel about the *Cyberpunk 2013* system and bought the black box from a vendor, has continued into the *Cyberpunk 2020* system, and has eventually become its own little thing.

If you're interested in creating a character for the game, [please click here.](/ccreation/)

If you're interested in some current game-related lore, [please click here.](/lore.html)

There will be more pages to come as things get smoothed out.

**Update for Feb. 10th, 2021**

I'm sorry to all the players who may have wanted minis for their characters as they probably won't get done. I need to take a break for my own health, the 9th threw me into a bit of a downward spiral and my head isn't clear enough to have it fixed without a temporary break from social media platforms, Discord, forums, and whatever else.

I'll be holding updates, the "Tonight Stuff" posts from the BCP Discord server, through this **Update** section. I'm unsure how many will see it but thanks if you do occasionally check and see these. So, with that said, tonight I would like to:

* Add new entries to **Nimu's Board**, at least three but up to six as I'm still behind by one day.

* Start the **Kipola** pages, possibly some sort of opener. These pages are able to change, imagine Emily erasing her writing or ripping out pages occasionally, so keep that in mind. I'm not saying keep a backup but...

* Work on the general game tables, stuff for the **ccreation** pages really, that way they're actually there.

* ~~(Non-Game) Update the home page with a nice "welcome" message.~~ Completed, subject to change.

* (Non-Game) Add a page for ongoing personal projects that way I have a place to document what I'm doing.

* (Non-Game) Work on my mental state so I'm (hopefully) good for SGFS stuff on Friday night.

I don't promise that any will get done, if it's a busy day again then that'll leave me with maybe an hour tops of spare time instead of the usual three, but I'll do my best to at least add to Nimu's Board.
