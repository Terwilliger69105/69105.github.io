## Welcome to the Burritoverse!

This is the hub for content related to my long-running series of half-failed yet still quite fun Cyberpunk-system games. Everything started back in 2013 when I went to a panel about the *Cyberpunk 2013* system and bought the black box from a vendor, has continued into the *Cyberpunk 2020* system, and has eventually become its own little thing.

If you're interested in creating a character for the game, [please click here.](/ccreation/)

If you're interested in some current game-related lore, [please click here.](/lore/)

There will be more pages to come as things get smoothed out. 

Thanks for reading!
