BV-G8SB is dead. All of the files are deleted, all of the papers are currently burning as I write this, and most-all of the Discord-related material won't ever be seen again. 

It hurts to type this out but the game really wasn't going well, this was probably for the best. I'll take being mentally broken for a month if it means I don't have to feel like I'm wasting the time of others.

I'm sorry to everyone and I hope you can eventually forgive me for fucking up.

A replacement game is in the works, not a "mainline" game but something which could easily turn into one. It's called ***The Price of Freedom*** and it's entirely based on an old dark sci-fi short story written by me back in 2014 for English class.

*Fun Fact: We didn't have to turn in drafts so the final paper got me sent to guidance counceling for a week!*

Players act as a group of slaves taken by SovOil and forced onto Deimos, Derevo Station to be specific, who need to get the hell out. Everything is falling apart, starvation is the norm since food isn't being brought often enough, commanders are more frequently issuing increasingly cruel and brutal punishment for their entertainment, and rumor has it the Experimental Energy Collector may be on the edge of doing something crazy. A transport is going to arrive in a few weeks, some nice cargo liner, so could you possibly work out a way to get out and escape for the NASA-led Chryse Base?

*Content Warning: Things get fucked up. See "group of slaves" and use your imagination.*

If you're interested to any extent then [join the server](https://discord.gg/sHaDpWjqvD) and we'll work it out from there.
