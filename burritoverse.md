## Welcome to the Burritoverse!

This is the hub for Andrew's *Burritoverse* series of Cyberpunk tabletop role-playing games. We're coming up on our eighth year running, it's currently the eighth mainline game, and we can't wait to keep it going for another eight!

If you're interested in creating a character for the game, [please click here.](/burritoverse/ccreation/)

If you're interested in some current game-related lore, [please click here.](/burritoverse/lore/)

The Inactivity timer is currently sitting at **4** days of content which need to be made up for.

There will be more pages to come as things get smoothed out.

**Update for Feb. 16th, 2021**

I just have to apologize. I'm really not sure about any of my writing to the point where I'm just avoiding doing it in fear. I've been forcing my own depressed head into every aspect, I've made irreversible decisions to some characters that I know just cause issues, I'm worried that I'm derailing my own story, and I have no confidence in anything I've been putting down. I honestly don't know what to do anymore and I just feel like I'm failing.

I'll try to do some work on the job board, it's nearly complete anyways, and I'll try to put some time into getting the master skill list up. I won't be posting anything in Discord so thanks if you do read this.
