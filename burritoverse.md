## Welcome to the Burritoverse!

This is the hub for Andrew's *Burritoverse* series of Cyberpunk tabletop role-playing games. We're coming up on our eighth year running, it's currently the eighth mainline game, and we can't wait to keep it going for another eight!

If you're interested in creating a character for the game, [please click here.](/ccreation/)

If you're interested in some current game-related lore, [please click here.](/lore.html)

There will be more pages to come as things get smoothed out.

Honestly just gonna let Halle do whatever. She's been doing good. Keep it up. I'll write if I have time.
