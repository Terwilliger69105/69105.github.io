BV-G8SB is dead. Idea #1, my old *The Price of Freedom* story, is also dead. Time for Idea #2.

*The year is 2021. The month is March. The day is the 11th.*

*An hour ago you got to attend what may have been one of the biggest media events to ever happen. Darren Lancaster, a serial rapist, just had the first "interactive execution" in a new program set up by the Federal Government. You, plus the rest of the nation, got to determine his fate. Of course you voted for Death, why wouldn't you? Sixty-four women and sixteen boys were ruined by that man! It was satisfying to see that scum get taken out. If only they had something more entertaining than a robotic firing squad...*

*...your phone rings. You pick it up. It's Oric. Your boss, a semi-corporatized fixer who gets company-level dirty work and assigns his aces to get it done. He's got a new job offer for you. 

*"This one is going to be slick, choom. No badges, no lizards, no dumbass FNG, and no yonos. Just a bunch of puppets and a bit of bac bac. Choi Labs, a Dyson Phyotology Dome in the Pacific, is looking better and better to hit every day. Suits are saying that they have some sort of new bionetic mods which they want their hands on. Should be locked behind some simple computer system, I'm sure any fucker with interface could break it. Easy shit, just get in then grab the thing and get out. They're giving us the boats, we can take any shredders we want since the fuzz won't exist 2,500m underwater, and there's a hot 10,000eb pay for everyone who goes. You interested? I've got a SHU-1 machine pistol with your name on it if you're game..."*

*Of course you're interested, who wouldn't be? It's not often you get an offer to go underwater, activity usually reserved for mega-geeks and red ties, so the new experience and massive pay sound like a hell of a good time. You tell Oric that you're in. Not twenty seconds later, spitting out your fax, are some details for meeting up at Pier Three Paradise in East Marina later tonight. Time to get to work.*

Character Creation rules will go up soon enough, you'll pretty much be pre-built into a core "solo-ish" with room to spec into whatever else you'd like to be good at (be it for RP or action) and if things go smooth then that character should be able to continue onwards. A
