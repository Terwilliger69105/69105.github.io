## Welcome to the Burritoverse!

This is the hub for Andrew's *Burritoverse* series of Cyberpunk tabletop role-playing games. We're coming up on our eighth year running, it's currently the eighth mainline game, and we can't wait to keep it going for another eight!

If you're interested in creating a character for the game, [please click here.](/ccreation/)

If you're interested in some current game-related lore, [please click here.](/lore.html)

There will be more pages to come as things get smoothed out.

**Update for Feb. 11th, 2021**

Alright, well none of that got done. I'm feeling a bit better though so I'll take the trade-off.

First thing, some of y'all had me confused. I heard people saying minis ended on the 10th, so I want to clear something up: The session before last took place on **August 6th** and then minis covered **August 7th.** Last session was the start of **August 8th** and your current minis run until the end of **August 9th.** Your next session takes place on **August 10th.** Everyone disappearing (Molly, Lance, Jodes) isn't a show, it's a meetup with the ex-Samurai members at a hotel followed by a trip to Heywood for a hyperjet back to Chicago. Just to make sure we're all on the same page for times. Lance and Molly get back at 11:30PM with a note written by the Jodes which I'll be sending to Halle for posting at some point.

~~I'm going to try to get Nimu's Board done for the day before I head to work at least,~~ that didn't work at all. I'll still try to get it done in downtime. I set my "idle" counter to two days so if I can come up with more during any downtime then I'll gladly do so then.

Past all that there really isn't much. I'm really kicking myself for not being caught up on the Kipola stuff but it's just too much to say "I'm just going to write" unitil I can get myself back into character for Emily. Sorry for always being behind on it.

Please make sure to get text for any mini stuff you want out to Halle, I won't have much time until 4:45PM on Saturday. She'll be fine with it, at the least she'll do 90% of it and send the rest to me for completion before session.

I'm unsure if I'm going to be able to run the SGFS stuff this weekend but I really want to. I just need to come up with a scenario, I kinda threw my last one out because I didn't like it. I'll figure it out. That's kinda priority for downtime tonight.
