## Welcome to the Burritoverse!

This is the hub for Andrew's *Burritoverse* series of Cyberpunk tabletop role-playing games. We're coming up on our eighth year running, it's currently the eighth mainline game, and we can't wait to keep it going for another eight!

If you're interested in creating a character for the game, [please click here.](/burritoverse/ccreation/)

If you're interested in some current game-related lore, [please click here.](/burritoverse/lore/)

The Inactivity timer is currently sitting at **4** days of content which need to be made up for.

There will be more pages to come as things get smoothed out.

**Update for Feb. 18th, 2021**

I keep fucking up your minis.

I fucked up two entire characters.

Just send me text minis unless you really want to risk having me ruin everything for you too

I'm sorry for being a fuck-up.
