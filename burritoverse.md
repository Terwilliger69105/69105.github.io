## Welcome to the Burritoverse!

This is the hub for Andrew's *Burritoverse* series of Cyberpunk tabletop role-playing games. We're coming up on our eighth year running, it's currently the eighth mainline game, and we can't wait to keep it going for another eight!

If you're interested in creating a character for the game, [please click here.](/ccreation/)

If you're interested in some current game-related lore, [please click here.](/lore.html)

The Inactivity timer is currently sitting at **6** days of content which need to be made up for.

There will be more pages to come as things get smoothed out.

**Update for Feb. 14th, 2021**

I need to prove to my own damn head that I can do this. If you want a text-based mini in the form of a file then just write it up and post it, Halle's going to be doing the responses to all of those. If you want a text-based mini with dialog then just PM me and we'll start going back and forth. If you want a voice-based mini then message me with what day and time you want it at. You have all of August 10th to cover, from whenever you went to sleep the night before to whenever you want to go to bed. 

I'm sorry for killing session but I couldn't do anything that night. All of my thoughts while I was out at dinner were telling me that I was being worthless, I was just listening to other people talk about things and feeling like I had no purpose being with that group, and the second I got home I was vomiting up everything I ate. I hope you understand why I had to call it off. I'm sorry for wasting your time sitting in voice just to hear we weren't doing anything.
