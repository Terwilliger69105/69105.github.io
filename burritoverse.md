## Welcome to the Burritoverse!

This is the hub for the *Burritoverse* series of Cyberpunk-based tabletop role-playing games. We're coming up on the eighth year running, it's currently the eighth mainline game, and hopefully we can make it another eight!

**Update for Feb. 23rd, 2021**

I re-thought my process for running stuff and damn it feels nice. Two nights of minis ran well, I'm not sitting here worried and scared of tonight, and it isn't a "I hope we can get a third" because I know we'll get a third, a foruth, and a fifth.

The Tonight plan is going to simply enough focus on two points, implementing the stuff from MDD#8.019D and adding to Nimu's Board. Thanks to those who responded to the MDD, it means a ton that you'd take a few minutes to read some writing I put down, and I hope that the expanded (full) mechanic doesn't let you down. Auras won't get much of a page, to be honest I don't think they need more than a quick mention on the Characters page (which is in-progress at the moment) but Corruption will get its own section that way things are explained.

I'm switching back to the BurritoBeans account on Wednesday, I smoothed out a few of the worries in other communities and having the game run well lets me have enough confidence to actually be around again. I do still want to attempt to go for pancakes/have people out on Saturday ~~but I'm not going to post it in Discord.~~ and I'll be posting about it to the usual places. No point hiding it from Discord, at this point I'd rather it be out there. Huge thanks to the few of you who've been helping me out.
