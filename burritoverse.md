## Welcome to the Burritoverse!

This is the hub for content related to my long-running series of half-failed yet still quite fun Cyberpunk-system games. Everything started back in 2013 when I went to a panel about the *Cyberpunk 2013* system and bought the black box from a vendor, has continued into the *Cyberpunk 2020* system, and has eventually become its own little thing.

If you're interested in creating a character for the game, [please click here.](/ccreation/)

If you're interested in some current game-related lore, [please click here.](/lore.html)

There will be more pages to come as things get smoothed out.

**Update for Feb. 10th, 2021**

I'm sorry to all the players who may have wanted minis for their characters as they probably won't get done. I need to take a break for my own health, the 9th threw me into a bit of a downward spiral and my head isn't clear enough to have it fixed without a temporary break from social media platforms, Discord, forums, and whatever else.

I'll be holding updates, the "Tonight Stuff" posts from the BCP Discord server, through this **Update** section. I'm unsure how many will see it but thanks if you do occasionally check and see these.

Tonight I would like to add three or four new entries to **Nimu's Board**, fix some dates which aren't lining up properly within said Board, get a start on the **Kipola** pages, and put some time into the **ccreation** pages by filling out missing tables. Part of me also wants to add more to this site, I feel it would be nice to have somewhere to just put down project logs, but the game things come first as I've failed to deliver for a few days in a row now.

Thanks for reading!
