## Welcome to the Burritoverse!

This is the hub for the *Burritoverse* series of Cyberpunk-based tabletop role-playing games. We're coming up on the eighth year running, it's currently the eighth mainline game, and hopefully we can make it another eight!

**Weekly Checklist**

1. ~~Make a "Characters" page with the stats and skills of each player for easier reference~~ Almost completed, I wanted to have it out today (Feb. 23rd) but it's being put aside until 8.019D pages are on-line.

2. ~~Rewrite and introduce MDD#8.019~~ Complete, MDD#8.019D created, public version approved through by 11 players, and being implemented as-of now (Feb. 23rd)

3. ~~Add at least two more tables to Character Creation~~ Waiting on Jenna

4. ~~Update Nimu's Board with at least two entries per-day~~ Failed two days but that's why we have inactivity timer

5. ~~Update the Kipola page at least once~~ Waiting on Jenna

6. Cover minis for as many players as would like them

7. Run a session
