## Welcome to the Burritoverse!

This is the hub for Andrew's *Burritoverse* series of Cyberpunk tabletop role-playing games. We're coming up on our eighth year running, it's currently the eighth mainline game, and we can't wait to keep it going for another eight!

If you're interested in creating a character for the game, [please click here.](/burritoverse/ccreation/)

If you're interested in some current game-related lore, [please click here.](/burritoverse/lore/)

The Inactivity timer is currently sitting at **6** days of content which need to be made up for.

There will be more pages to come as things get smoothed out.

**Update for Feb. 15th, 2021**

If you're reading this update then hey, thanks! I'm going to be posting the "Tonight Things" stuff on Discord too but this one will actually get updated as the night goes on.

* I'm going to be putting a new webpage live, "Molly's Job Board" or so I'm calling it at the moment, sometime within the next day or two. It simply enough is just that, a job board which anyone can go to and do stuff from with Molly paying you out. Hopefully having the added simple-to-see side-quests will give you more things to do! They're available to everyone, there will be everything from courier jobs to hacks and hits, and it'll be updated probably once per week.

* I'm going to redo some of these links, the "Lore" page (being that it's just boards of info) will probably be converted to the "Information" page which will include the upcoming Job Board.

* Halle is doing some finishing touches on drug tables, we're hoping to have those out by the end of the week as they need a little more playtesting

* You've recieved a second letter from the Birds but probably haven't seen it yet. Go talk with Emily, she's been grabbing your mail!
