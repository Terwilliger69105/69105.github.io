Due to doubt of the current state of the game, in my opinion about two months of dead sessions and time wasting, BV-G8SB is currently on hold.

There is no current plan for the game but everything is being considered in an attempt to fix things.

There is a chance that the game is cancelled. In this event BV-G8BI will continue as-normal and -G8SB will be reformed into -G8XX or turned into what becomes G9.

Apologies for fucking up so much.
