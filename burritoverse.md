BV-G8SB is dead.

Now Halle's messaging me repeatedly telling me to not run the idea I've wanted to for years. I get told in voice that it's too uncomfortable. Fine, I guess I'll go burn that too. I thought it was a really good story, I guess I'm just wrong.

Should I just quit at this point? People are pretty much agreeing with me that it's a good idea.

I'll try one more attempt at coming up with a story. Just one. 

If it fails then fine, I'll quit being a GM and go back to my old friend suicidal thoughts. At least those lead somewhere entertaining for others.
