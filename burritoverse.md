## Welcome to the Burritoverse!

This is the hub for Andrew's *Burritoverse* series of Cyberpunk tabletop role-playing games. We're coming up on our eighth year running, it's currently the eighth mainline game, and we can't wait to keep it going for another eight!

If you're interested in creating a character for the game, [please click here.](/burritoverse/ccreation/)

If you're interested in some current game-related lore, [please click here.](/burritoverse/lore/)

The Inactivity timer is currently sitting at **4** days of content which need to be made up for.

There will be more pages to come as things get smoothed out.

**Update for Feb. 20th, 2021**

Tonight is going to actually run a session, even if I get fucked up I'll do everything I can to stick it out. There are a few mechanics I want to introduce, the design document is being taken with me tonight where I think one or two players are then if they like it I'll be posting it on here too. Thanks for reading this if you do!
