Want to know what else I'll GM? **OTRPGs** simply just means "Other Tabletop RPGs" and this page is simply a listing of exactly those. It's going to be a bit bare at the moment, over time I'll expand it more.

**Mothership**

I found this game a few years back, one of the last people to ever run me in a game was quite the fan of it and we ran two sessions. I enjoyed the hell out of it, it's extremely simple yet extremely chaotic and may honestly be a game I use to introduce people to tabletop role-play titles due to exactly that.

I have one game set to inactive, the only game I've run, which used to be under the now-dead *SGFS* setup. It revolved around a forced crew, prisioners on the *Prospero's Dream* station for all sorts of reasons ranging from not paying their oxygen tax to smuggling, who was sent off to the asteroid *Ypsilon 14* to do slave labor. Of course that never happened, all but two of the station crew were killed by an alien being who was living in cryostasis on the asteroid and woken up by the mining operation, and the players left off while heading back to *Prospero's Dream* to report their adventures. I am willing to pick it up again, I've been kicking myself for canceling the adventure as it was tons of fun for that little three-hour session, I'd just need the players to tell me they want it again.

I currently have no plan for starting any other games in this system but I know I'll want to in the coming months. Check this page occasionally as I may update things with a google form for player sign-ups!

Did I mention that it's going to be bare? Sorry about that.
