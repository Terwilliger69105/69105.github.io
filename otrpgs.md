Want to know what else I'll GM? **OTRPGs** simply just means "Other Tabletop RPGs" and this page is simply a listing of exactly those. It's going to be a bit bare at the moment, over time I'll expand it more.

**Mothership**

I found this game at most a couple years ago, one of the last people to ever run me in a game was quite the fan of it and we ran two sessions. I enjoyed the hell out of it, it's extremely simple yet extremely chaotic, and Mothership may just be a system I use to introduce people to tabletop role-play.

One game is currently set to inactive, the old SGFS game. A forced party, prisioners from the station *Prospero's Dream* (detailed in *A Pound of Flesh*), were sent off to the mining colony on asteroid *Ypsilon 14* as slaves for a month. Of course that didn't go well, after all the mining operation was disturbing a certain alien lifeform who was traveling peacefully in cryostasis until those pesky humans showed up. Not many survived, between the players and NPCs there were a lot of deaths, but they did make it off while destroying the asteroid and killing the alien. Currently everybody who lived is in cryosleep, they're heading back to *Prospero's Dream* to report what happened and try their hand at gaining freedom. I would love to pick this game back up, I kick myself weekly for canceling it as it's in a great spot to come back at any time, but I need to ask the players if they would like to continue it before anything else.

I currently have no plan for starting any other games in this system, if anything I'd love to do a few more sessions with the crew I ran before as I'm still learning the system, but I know I'll want to do something in the coming months. Check this page occasionally, there may be a surprise Google Form for my next adventure I run!

Did I mention that it's going to be bare? Sorry about that.

Thanks for reading!
