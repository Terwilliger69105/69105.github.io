## Welcome to "PagePunk" AKA everything you need to play in a BurritoVerse game! 

Apologies for awkward navigation, at the moment everything is plain Markdown in one file as the website isn't redirecting very kindly.

## Character Creation - Role

There are no roles in a BurritoVerse game.

I don't much care for having static roles, I feel you should be able to build whatever you want. Ignore this section of the core rulebook and stock player sheet. View the Skills page for details as to how this changes character creation.

----

## Character Creation - Stats

You have nine main statistics, little values that say how good you are at broad tasks, which you define during character creation. These include:

**Intelligence (INT):** How good are you at solving problems?

**Reflexes (REF):** Your natural dexterity and physical coordination.

**Cool (CL):** How well you stand up to stress, pressure, fear, pain, and torture.

**Technical Ability (TECH):** Your ability to use, analyze, and repair technology.

**Luck (LK):** Do the potential powers above favor you?*

**Attractiveness (ATT):** Are you going to turn heads towards or away from you?

**Movement Allowance (MA):** How fast you can run. Your **RUN** stat is calculated by multiplying this number by 3, and your **LEAP** is determined by dividing that **RUN** stat by four.

**Empathy:** How well you relate to other living things, a mix of charisma and sympathetic emotion. Your **Humanity** is determined by multiplying this by ten.

**Body Type (BT):** Your strength, endurance, constitution, and more. View the chart at the bottom of this page to determine your **Body Type Modifier (BTM)**.

Because of a want to keep characters at a point where they progress upwards, not possibly superhumans off the bat, **start with 55 points to distribute among these main stats.** Don't follow the core rulebook, don't listen to some post on Reddit, etc. as none of it applies to this game. You will get more over time!

## Character Creation - Skills

Make sure, before finalizing your skills, to go through the **Character Creation - Advantages and Disadvantages** section of this webpage!

*To Be Completed, additional skills from non-core books and homebrew whatnots are being added!*

*If you can't wait then just use the core book, determine Skill Points through (INT+REF) x 2, remove all role-associated skills but turn Interface & Jury Rig & MedTech into TECH skills, remember that without advantage you may only have up to 10 points in a skill, and go from there!*

## Character Creation - Advantages & Disadvantages

Advantages and Disadvantages are an added feature to BurritoVerse which allow players to take specific boosts and flaws. You may draw from or add to your skill point pool, removing and/or adding up to 12 skill points if you would like, during character creation. Simply go to the tables, if Advantage then subtract the (#SP) from your Skill Points pool or it Disadvantage then add (#SP) to your Skill Points pool. You may not buy more advantages during gameplay but you may "sell off" non-permanent disadvantages.

To view Advantages & Disadvantages, *to be finished!*

## Character Creation - Money

Determine your starting money by rolling 2D10 and multiplying the result by 250.

----

## Character Creation - Lifepath

Lifepath, a set of rolls you make for every year of age on you once you hit 16, is a quick-and-dirty way of adding some nice background to your character. It may just be silly stuff, it could be extra (or less) money, it could add friends and enemies to the game, or it may even cause you to have a kid!

You aren't stuck to your lifepath, in fact re-rolls are accepted as long as you contact the GM before making them and don't cheat rolls to say all give extra money.

To view the Lifepath tables, *to be finished!*

## Character Creation - Reputation

Unless you've talked with the GM, this number will start out at 0. Don't worry about it!
