*Where am I?*

Welcome to **69105.xyz**

---

*What is this website?*

**69105.xyz** is a personal site for me, *Andrew* (also known by the names *BurritoBeans*, *69105L*, and *CDP*), where I put random things down.

---

*What kinds of random things?*

Well, really just whatever is in-line with my hobbies. I do art, mostly animations of the adult variety for commission but also whatever I find cool. I love tons of genres of music. I collect retro game systems and computers, even some arcade PCBs. I've been running tabletop RPGs, mainly AD&D and Cyberpunk (2013/2020/my own "Burritoverse" variant) for nearly eight years. I quite enjoy black powder, mainly flintlock, firearms. The list goes on...

---

*Can I see some of your art?*

I'm not the type to show off what I make, it doesn't really feel right for me to do. Go support whatever you think is cool!

---

*What type of music do you like?*

Well, a big mix. At the moment I've been quite enjoying some [Hip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfurJlc4Bbs) [Hop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weWTuvdL-LQ), various types of metal like [Black](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLSUQYzqXZ0) and [Prog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9qZ4Tntg8I) Metal, [Electronic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00vYncpl0pk), a little bit of [R&B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjAKeduaURc), and some [Alt Rock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8rUl-gsCIg).

---

*Old stuff?*

Yeah, old stuff. Some of my names match up to this, **69105L** being a *Zork* reference and **CDP** to the old RCA chips, and you'll find those names under places for the interest. I've been on a bit of a foreign computer kick for a while, a recent PC-9821As3 and PC-9801UV11 bringing me back into the Japanese scene, but I get the feeling I'll be back onto minis like the PDP-11 soon enough...

---

*You run tabletop RPGs?*

Yeah. I'm not a good player at all, I'm either too quiet or too annoyingly loud with my characters, but I do enjoy running things. They also just keep me being social. I need to re-work basically everything with how I'm handling them. I had this idea for a S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and Nether-inspired variant of a city, maybe Seattle, for a *Cyberpunk*-ish game which just kinda died but I'm still really interested in doing. Maybe I'll start on that again soon here. 

---

*Guns?*

Yeah, guns. I like them kinda? I'm of the view that they need to have a reasonable purpose, for me that means hunting game or being of historical value which I enjoy, so I mostly only handle black poweder firearms as I feel they provide a nice challenge. It's also just a personal protest against semi-automatic hunting which I view as stupidly overkill.

---

I hit everything in the list so I'll stop it there. Feel free to check the **Contact** page if you want to do just that, get in contact with me, and I'm sure I'll have more added on here soon enough.

Thanks for stopping by.
