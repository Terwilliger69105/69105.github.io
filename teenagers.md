**Welcome to Teenagers from Outer Space!**

*"Consider, if you will, the possibilities present when several hundred thousand alien teenyboppers from an uncountable number of planets all start slumming on Earth (the "Fun Planet"). Think of it as Easter Vacation at Fort Lauderdale meets Plan Nine From Outer Space. Scary, isn't it? But it gets even worse.*

*Teenagers From Outer Space is more than just a mere hysterically funny book packed with weird pictures and chock fulla nifty commentary. It's also a game-an interactive one where you not only make up your own adventures, but star in them as well, playing any one of a million wild and wacky characters! Where else can you experience the unique opportunity to cover Manhattan Island in 500 feet of shaving cream? Grow an extra arm to improve your "Horizontal Combat" Skills? Drag race the Starship Enterprise in your flying saucermobile? Make a clone of yourself who goes to History class while you go to the beach?"*
