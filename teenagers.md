**Welcome to Teenagers from Outer Space!**

*"Consider, if you will, the possibilities present when several hundred thousand alien teenyboppers from an uncountable number of planets all start slumming on Earth (the "Fun Planet"). Think of it as Easter Vacation at Fort Lauderdale meets Plan Nine From Outer Space. Scary, isn't it? But it gets even worse.*

*Teenagers From Outer Space is more than just a mere hysterically funny book packed with weird pictures and chock fulla nifty commentary. It's also a game-an interactive one where you not only make up your own adventures, but star in them as well, playing any one of a million wild and wacky characters! Where else can you experience the unique opportunity to cover Manhattan Island in 500 feet of shaving cream? Grow an extra arm to improve your "Horizontal Combat" Skills? Drag race the Starship Enterprise in your flying saucermobile? Make a clone of yourself who goes to History class while you go to the beach?"*

**So what makes up a character?**

Not that much!

Grab [the character sheet](https://rtalsoriangames.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tfosfreebies.pdf). The core rulebook does a great job at explaining the process, it's quite the rules-light system, so reference that for everything.

**What have you changed?**

Not that much! Common theme, eh?

For the sake of silliness and options, we've changed the *Boy/Girl Gun* to be more of a *Everything Gun*. A dimmer switch exists on the side, the top being pure male and the bottom being pure female, so feel free to adjust as you please!

Going with that, the *Boy/Girl/Boy?* Power lets you go anywhere you want instead of just going to the dead opposite sex. Be warned that this causes things to get a little random, if you're not going straight to the opposite then you'll have to roll 1D6 to see where you land for the added possibility of embarresment!

Finally, again going with the whole physical part of it all, we do allow things to get a bit steamier within sessions. Just be careful, you don't know who may walk in or what may happen when you get down to it!

**When's the first session?**

We're going to go over characters, help anyone make a character who doesn't have one yet, and do our first episode on **Saturday, February 6th** from **12:45AM to 3:30AM.** Be there or prep an excuse before as your teachers may have strict late work policies!
