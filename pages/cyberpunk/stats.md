You have nine main statistics, little values that say how good you are at broad tasks, which you define during character creation. These include:

* **Intelligence (INT):** How good are you at solving problems?

* **Reflexes (REF):** Your natural dexterity and physical coordination.

* **Cool (CL):** How well you stand up to stress, pressure, fear, pain, and torture.

* **Technical Ability (TECH):** Your ability to use, analyze, and repair technology.

* **Luck (LK):** Do the potential powers above favor you?*

* **Attractiveness (ATT):** Are you going to turn heads towards or away from you?

* **Movement Allowance (MA):** How fast you can run. Your **RUN** stat is calculated by multiplying this number by 3, and your **LEAP** is determined by dividing that **RUN** stat by four.

* **Empathy:** How well you relate to other living things, a mix of charisma and sympathetic emotion. Your **Humanity** is determined by multiplying this by ten.

* **Body Type (BT):** Your strength, endurance, constitution, and more. View the chart at the bottom of this page to determine your **Body Type Modifier (BTM)**.

Because of a want to keep characters at a point where they progress upwards, not possibly superhumans off the bat, **start with 55 points to distribute among these main stats.** Don't follow the core rulebook, don't listen to some post on Reddit, etc. as none of it applies to this game. You will get more over time!
