**SGFS**, the "Small Group Fun Stuff" as we call it, is a little set of games which get run late on Friday nights/Saturday mornings. We bounce from system to system, currently involving a *Mothership* adventure and *Teenagers From Outer Space*, and the whole goal is to just make sure people have fun.

**Mothership** is currently on hold!

The game will continue, as you reead your characters are heading back to *Prospero's Dream* to be released from slavery by Brunhildh for completing your job at Ypsilon 14. Once the *Teenagers from Outer Space* game is completed we will be revisitng this system and continuing your story, new characters for those who passed and the same old characters for those who survived!

Thank you for making my first *Mothership* game so much fun, I really did enjoy running it and I'm glad you enjoyed playing in it!

**Teenagers From Outer Space** is currently in-progress!

We've only run a demo session, something simple post-character creation, so there will be two to four more weeks of this game until we go back to Mothership. 

Grab [the character sheet](https://rtalsoriangames.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tfosfreebies.pdf). The core rulebook does a great job at explaining the process, it's quite the rules-light system, so reference that for everything.

For the sake of silliness and options, we've changed the *Boy/Girl Gun* to be more of a *Everything Gun*. A dimmer switch exists on the side, the top being pure male and the bottom being pure female, so feel free to adjust as you please!

Going with that, the *Boy/Girl/Boy?* Power lets you go anywhere you want instead of just going to the dead opposite sex. Be warned that this causes things to get a little random, if you're not going straight to the opposite then you'll have to roll 1D6 to see where you land for the added possibility of embarresment!

Finally, again going with the whole physical part of it all, we do allow things to get a bit steamier within sessions. Just be careful, you don't know who may walk in or what may happen when you get down to it!

The third system to be run will most likely be a small **Cyberpunk 2020** game featuring various *Ianus Games* alternate reality supplements.

Thanks for reading!
